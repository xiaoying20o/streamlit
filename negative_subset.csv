,"market for tobacco products has generally been declining in terms of volume of sales, and is expected to continue to decline. The general climate of declining sales of tobacco products is principally driven by the long-standing declines in cigarettes.

Further, a major fire, violent weather conditions or other disasters that affect us or any of our key suppliers or producers, including Bollor , Swedish Match, Durfort or JJA, as well as those of our other suppliers and vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Although we have insurance coverage for some of these events, a prolonged interruption in our operations, as well as those of our producers, suppliers and vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition to the FDA and FCC, we are subject to regulation by numerous other federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission FTC ), the Department of Justice DOJ ), the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau TTB ), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA ), the U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA ), the Consumer Product Safety Commission CPSC ), the U.S. The tobacco industry expects significant regulatory developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the FCTC. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:

				 the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements; 

				 restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging; 

				 restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines; 

				 requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents levels; 

				 requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients; 

				 increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors; 

				 elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and 

				 encouraging litigation against tobacco companies.

"These seasonal factors are
 common in the building products distribution industry. The first
 and fourth quarters are typically our slowest quarters due to
 the impact of poor weather on the construction market. Our
 second and third quarters are typically our strongest quarters,
 reflecting a substantial increase in construction due to more
 favorable weather conditions. Our working capital and accounts
 receivable and payable generally peak in the third quarter,
 while inventory generally peaks in the second quarter in
 anticipation of the summer building season.","Market prices of building products
 historically have been volatile and cyclical and we have limited
 ability to control the timing and amount of pricing changes for
 building products. Demand for building products is driven mainly
 by factors outside of our control, such as general economic and
 political conditions, interest rates, the construction, repair
 and remodeling and industrial markets, weather and population
 growth. The supply of building products fluctuates based on
 available manufacturing capacity, and excess capacity in the
 industry can result in significant declines in market prices for
 those products. Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service also
 remain subject to both federal and state regulation. More
 restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer
 length and configuration, or driver hours of service would
 increase our costs, which, if we are unable to pass these cost
 increases on to our customers, would reduce our gross margins,
 increase our selling, general and administrative expenses and
 reduce our net income.

Environmental
 laws impose risks and costs on us. 

Our operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and
 local laws, rules and regulations governing the protection of
 the environment, including, but not limited to, those regulating
 discharges into the air and water, the use, handling and
 disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, the management of
 wastes, the cleanup of contamination and the control of noise
 and odors. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures
 to comply with these requirements. While we believe, based upon
 current information, that we are in substantial compliance with
 all applicable environmental laws, rules and regulations, we
 could be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties
 for any failure to comply. Moreover, under certain environmental
 laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property,
 and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that

are disposed of at real property, may be held liable for the
 cost to investigate or clean up such real property and for
 related damages to natural resources. We may be subject to
 liability, including liability for investigation and cleanup
 costs, if contamination is discovered at one of our current or
 former warehouse facilities, or at a landfill or other location
 where we have disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of,
 wastes. Georgia-Pacific has agreed to indemnify us against any
 claim arising from environmental conditions that existed prior
 to May 7, 2004. We also carry environmental insurance.
 However, any remediation costs not related to conditions
 existing prior to May 7, 2004 may not be covered by
 indemnification. In addition, certain remediation costs may not
 be covered by insurance. In addition, we could be subject to
 claims brought pursuant to applicable laws, rules or regulations
 for property damage or personal injury resulting from the
 environmental impact of our operations. Increasingly stringent
 environmental requirements, more aggressive enforcement actions,
 the discovery of unknown conditions or the bringing of future
 claims may cause our expenditures for environmental matters to
 increase, and we may incur material costs associated with these
 matters.

Recent Developments 

On August 6, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.125 per share on
our common stock. The dividend is payable on September 28, 2007 to stockholders of record as of
September 14, 2007.

On July 11, 2007, we agreed with our insurer to a settlement of our outstanding insurance
claims related to damage to our New Orleans distribution center and its inventory caused by
Hurricane Katrina. We anticipate that the net effect of the receipt of insurance proceeds will
result in a gain of approximately 1.7 million to be recognized by us in the third quarter of

First quarter cash flow was primarily impacted by a onetime shift of approximately $100 million in tax payments related to Hurricane Irma from late 2017 into the first quarter of 2018.

,"Such interruptions may occur as a result of, for example, catastrophic events or rolling blackouts. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, telecommunication failures, hurricanes, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. 
 
 Increased competition in our Rhode Island market, in particular, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any adverse change in general economic conditions (including those that impact the stock market) can adversely affect consumer spending, which can adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from operations. Adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world including a general tightening of the availability of credit, increasing energy costs, rising prices, inflation, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, declining consumer confidence, significant declines in the stock market or epidemics, pandemics or other health-related events or widespread illnesses, like the ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, could lead to a reduction in visitors to our properties, including those that stay in our hotels, or discretionary spending by our customers on entertainment and leisure activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Recessions have affected our business and financial condition, and economic conditions may continue to affect them in ways that currently cannot accurately be predicted. 
 
 Our business is subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. Such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor, unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems, work stoppages, weather interference and unanticipated cost increases. Most of these factors are beyond our control. As a result, we are subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company that has greater geographical diversity. The risks to which we may have a greater degree of exposure include the following: 
 
 local economic and competitive conditions; 
 
 inaccessibility due to weather conditions, road construction or closure of primary access routes; 
 
 changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations; 
 
 natural and other disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes and flooding; 
 
 a decline in the number of residents in or near, or visitors to, our operations; 
 
 an increase in gaming activities in neighboring jurisdictions; and 
 
 a decrease in gaming activities at any of our facilities. 
 
 Any of the factors outlined above could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness. Moreover, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities. 
 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as the management and disposal of solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. These laws and regulations, which are complex and subject to change, include United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations. In addition, our horse racing facility in Colorado is subject to state laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations CAFO on water quality, including, but not limited to, storm water discharges. CAFO regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards. Enforcement of CAFO regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention. Compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures. For example, we may incur future costs under existing and new laws and regulations pertaining to storm water and wastewater management at our racetracks. Moreover, violations can result in significant penalties and, in some instances, interruption or cessation of operations. The presence of, or failure to remediate properly, such materials may adversely affect the ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral. Additionally, as an owner or manager of real property, we could be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination at or emanating from third party sites. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or manager knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants and the liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. In addition, environmental requirements address the impacts of development on wetlands. 
 
 The possibility exists that contamination, as yet unknown, may exist on our properties. There can be no assurance that we will not incur expenditures for environmental investigations or remediation in the future. 
 
 We are largely dependent on the skill and experience of management and key personnel. 
 
 All of our facilities are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time, as the result of casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, or extended or extraordinary maintenance, among other causes. In addition, our gaming operations could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions. These risks are particularly pronounced at our Hard Rock Biloxi property because of its location adjacent to water and the potential for hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 
 Our operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results, and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuations in the future. Furthermore, management believes that substantially all visitors to the Rhode Island casinos arrive by some form of ground transportation. Therefore, even normal winter weather may cause revenues and cash flows for our Rhode Island and Delaware operations to be adversely affected. Our recently acquired Black Hawk Casinos are subject to similar risks. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage. 
 
 Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, or other catastrophic events, including war and terrorism. 
 
 Natural disasters, such as major hurricanes, typhoons, floods, fires and earthquakes, could adversely affect our business and operating results. Hurricanes are common in the areas in which our Mississippi property is located, and the severity of such natural disasters is unpredictable. 
 
 For example, in 2005, prior to our ownership, Hurricane Katrina destroyed the Hard Rock Biloxi before its opening and the property had to be rebuilt. In 2017, customer traffic to the Hard Rock Biloxi was negatively impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Nate. 
 
 Catastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks in the United States and elsewhere, have had a negative effect on travel and leisure expenditures, including lodging, gaming (in some jurisdictions) and tourism. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or choose to purchase any insurance coverage with respect to occurrences of terrorist acts and any losses that could result from these acts. If there is a prolonged disruption at our facilities due to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. 
 
 We may be unable to obtain business interruption coverage for casualties resulting from severe weather such as hurricanes, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain casualty insurance coverage at affordable rates, if at all, for casualties resulting from severe weather.

Commodity Price Risk 

Many of the food products purchased by us are affected by weather, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources, which helps to control food product and supply risks.","Our ability to expand successfully will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: 

Negotiating acceptable lease or purchase terms for new restaurants; 

Cost effective and timely planning, design and build-out of restaurants; 

Creating guest awareness of our restaurants in new markets; 

Competition in new and existing markets; 

Impact of inclement weather, natural disasters, and other calamities; and 

General economic conditions. 

We must identify and obtain a sufficient number of suitable new restaurant sites for us to sustain our growth. 

Shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues. 

Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants caused by inclement weather, terrorist attacks, natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes, pandemics, the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market, food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements, or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists. Factors may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during fall and winter months based on the relative popularity and extent of national, regional and local sporting and other events. Further, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of other factors, including: 

Fluctuations in food costs, particularly chicken wings; 

The timing of new restaurant openings, which may impact margins due to the related preopening costs and initially higher restaurant level operating expense ratios; 

Potential distraction or unusual expenses associated with our expansion into international markets; 

Our ability to operate effectively in new markets domestically and internationally in which we or our franchisees have limited operating experience; 

Labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel; 

Changes in competitive factors; 

Disruption in supplies; 

General economic conditions, consumer confidence, and fluctuations in discretionary spending; 

Claims experience for self-insurance programs; 

Increases or decreases in labor or other variable expenses; 

The impact of inclement weather, natural disasters, and other calamities; 

Fluctuations in interest rates; 

The timing and amount of asset impairment loss and restaurant closing charges; and 

Tax expenses and other non-operating costs. 

As a result of the factors discussed above, our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly. 

We currently maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters. Such damages could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.","[""It's very difficult to isolate the effect of weather. Last year, there was Hurricane Sandy.

"There are a number of factors
that can create variability in contract performance and therefore impact the

 fuel; 

customer
 delays and work stoppages due to weather and environmental
 restrictions; 

availability
 and skill level of
workers; and

 change in availability and proximity of equipment and
 materials. 

All of
these factors can impose inefficiencies on contract performance, which can
impact the timing of revenue recognition and contract profitability. base realignment and closure program
 (BRAC); 

increased
 spending by the United States Navy and Coast
 Guard; 

strong

ongoing
 U.S. coastal wetlands restoration and
 reclamation; 

recurring
 hurricane restoration and
repair; and 

the
 23 billion federal water resources development funding bill of 2007
 (WRDA). 

In the
aggregate, these industry trends drive marine transportation facility
construction, dredging, bridge building, repair and maintenance, as well as
specialty services that we perform in our markets. 

Other
Factors 

 Other
factors that will influence our operations in future periods include the
following: 

Seasonality. Substantially
all of our services are performed on, over and under the water, causing our
results to be subject to seasonal variations due to weather conditions. The core
markets in which we operate the Gulf Coast, the Atlantic Seaboard and the
Caribbean Basin are affected by hurricanes and tropical storms during
hurricane season, which occurs annually in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean
from June through November. Over 97 of the hurricanes and tropical storms occur
during this time period, and 78 occur from August through October. Since we
operate our business in a wet environment and many of our marine projects are
constructed to withstand harsh conditions such as hurricanes and tropical
storms, wet conditions generally do not affect our operations, but major
hurricanes and tropical storms may temporarily impact our operations. For
example, we monitor all named storm systems to determine which, if any, of our
projects will be affected. Because hurricanes and tropical storms move slowly,
we usually have ample time to prepare appropriately for the storm, which
typically includes demobilizing much of our equipment and removing our employees
from the job site. Once the storm has passed, we must then mobilize our
personnel and equipment back to the job site, which results in delays in the
completion of our work and an increase in the costs associated with performing
our work. 

Generally,
in our fixed-price contracts we bear the risks of increased costs, delays to
completion of work, damage to our equipment, and damage to the work already
completed at a job site, related to severe weather conditions, such as
hurricanes and tropical storms. Consequently, our cost estimates to complete a
job in a hurricane prone area during hurricane season include costs related to
mobilizing and demobilizing personnel and equipment, and our schedule assumes
there will be delays associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. In years
where the hurricane activity is less than expected or does not significantly
impact our job sites, as was the case in 2006 and 2007, we release those
contingencies within our jobs as they are completed, which generally results in
the recognition of profit and usually occurs during the fourth quarter when
hurricane season has subsided. 

Surety Bonding. Over the
past several months, certain economic indicators suggesting a weaker US economy
have raised short-term concerns regarding the stability and outlook of US
domestic spending. We believe that developments such as increased coastal
restoration and protection, hurricane repair work, continued port expansion,
emphasis on bridge and causeway repair and replacements, and the enactment of
WRDA (discussed above) are keeping our end markets stable. We also believe that
the diversity of our end markets, both by type as well as geographic location,
enable us to shift our resources to end markets that may be more robust than
others. The increase in gross margin was primarily
due to the increase in dredging services, which historically have had a higher
gross profit margin, as well and improved margins on projects in Florida and the
Caribbean Basin as a result of higher productivity and favorable results
relative to planned contingencies. In addition, gross margins in 2005 were lower
due to disruptions in work schedules due to the active hurricane
season. These factors resulted in a decrease in the amount of work
that was performed by subcontractors, which is typically performed at lower
margins, a decrease in the cost for direct materials, which we typically do not
mark up as much as our other costs, and an improvement in the utilization of our
equipment.","These, in turn, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on such contracts can
vary, sometimes substantially, from the original projections due to changes in a
variety of factors, such as: 

failure
 to properly estimate costs of engineering, material, equipment or
 labor; 

unanticipated
 technical problems with the structures or services being supplied by us,
 which may require that we spend our own money to remedy the
 problem; 

project
 modifications creating unanticipated
costs; 

changes
 in the costs of equipment, materials, labor or
 subcontractors; 

our
 suppliers or subcontractors failure to
 perform; 

difficulties
 in our customers obtaining required governmental permits or
 approvals; 

changes
 in local laws and regulations; 

delays
 caused by local weather
conditions; and 

exacerbation
 of any one or more of these factors as projects grow in size and
 complexity. 

These
risks increase if the duration of the project is long-term because there is an
elevated risk that the circumstances upon which we based our original bid will
change in a manner that increases costs. 

Our business is
subject to significant operating risks and hazards that could result 
 in damage
or destruction to persons or property, which could result in losses or 
 liabilities
to us. 

The
businesses of marine infrastructure construction, port maintenance, dredging and
salvage are generally subject to a number of risks and hazards, including
environmental hazards, industrial accidents, adverse weather conditions,
collisions with fixed objects, cave-ins, encountering unusual or unexpected
geological formations, disruption of transportation services and flooding. These
risks could result in damage to or destruction of, dredges, transportation
vessels, other maritime structures and buildings, and could also result in
personal injury or death, environmental damage, performance delays, monetary
losses or legal liability. 

Our
safety record is an important consideration for our customers. We may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot
identify suitable companies or assets or reach agreement on potential strategic
acquisitions on acceptable terms. Moreover, an acquisition involves certain
risks, including: 

difficulties
 in the integration of operations, systems, policies and
 procedures; 

enhancements
 in our controls and procedures including those necessary for a public
 company may make it more difficult to integrate operations and
 systems; 

failure
 to implement proper overall business controls, including those required to
 support our growth, resulting in inconsistent operating and financial
 practices at companies we acquire or have
 acquired; 

termination
 of relationships with the key personnel and customers of an acquired
 company; 

additional
 financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax
 planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal
 controls; 

the
 incurrence of environmental and other liabilities, including liabilities
 arising from the operation of an acquired business or asset prior to our
 acquisition for which we are not indemnified or for which the indemnity is
 inadequate; 

disruption
 of our ongoing business or receipt of insufficient management
 attention; and 

inability
 to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits that we
 anticipate. 

Future
acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which
may not be available on attractive terms. 

We have
been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions claiming
damages in connection with marine infrastructure projects and other matters.
These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business,
including employment-related claims and contractual disputes or claims for
personal injury (including asbestos-related lawsuits) or property damage which
occurs in connection with services performed relating to project or construction
sites. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged
personal injury, workers compensation, employment discrimination, breach of
contract, property damage, environmental damage, punitive damages, civil
penalties or other losses, consequential damages or injunctive or declaratory
relief. Contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the timely
completion of projects, performance of equipment, design or other engineering
services or project services. In
addition, payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely
affect our liquidity position. 

We are
currently engaged in litigation related to claims arising from Hurricane
Katrina. See Business Legal Proceedings. 

Our operations
are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may expose us 
 to
significant costs and liabilities. 

Our
marine infrastructure construction, salvage, demolition, dredging and dredge
material disposal activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state
and local environmental laws and regulations, including those concerning air
emissions, water quality, solid waste management, and protection of certain
marine and bird species, their habitats, and wetlands. We may incur substantial
costs in order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and
regulations. For instance, we may be required to obtain, maintain and comply
with permits and other approvals (as well as those obtained for projects by our
customers) issued by various federal, state and local governmental authorities;
limit or prevent releases of materials from our operations in accordance with
these permits and approvals; and install pollution control equipment. In
addition, compliance with environmental laws and regulations can delay or
prevent our performance of a particular project and increase related project
costs. Moreover, new, stricter environmental laws, regulations or enforcement
policies could be implemented that significantly increase our compliance costs,
or require us to adopt more costly methods of operation.

Table of Contents 

Failure
to comply with environmental laws and regulations, or the permits issued under
them, may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal
penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of
injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. In addition,
strict joint and several liability may be imposed under certain environmental
laws, which could cause us to become liable for the investigation or remediation
of environmental contamination that resulted from the conduct of others or from
our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time
those actions were taken. Further, it is possible that we may be exposed to
liability due to releases of pollutants, or other environmental impacts that may
arise in the course of our operations. For instance, some of the work we perform
is in underground and water environments, and if the field location maps or
waterway charts supplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present in
the soil or water that are not indicated on the field location maps or waterway
charts, our underground and underwater work could strike objects in the soil or
the waterway bottom containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge
of pollutants. In addition, we sometimes perform directional drilling operations
below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies, and due to
the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it is possible that
such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface
materials. These releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts
permitted by law, may expose us to remediation costs and fines and legal actions
by private parties seeking damages for non-compliance with environmental laws
and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. We may not be able to
recover some or any of these costs through insurance or increased revenues,
which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and
financial condition. See Business Environmental Matters for more
information. 

Our operations
are susceptible to adverse weather conditions in our regions of
operation. 

Our
business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and
adversely affected by severe weather, particularly along the Gulf Coast, the
Atlantic Seaboard and Caribbean Basin where we have concentrated operations.
Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include: 

evacuation
 of personnel and curtailment of
services; 

weather-related
 damage to our equipment, facilities and project work sites resulting in
 suspension of operations; 

inability
 to deliver materials to jobsites in accordance with contract
 schedules; and 

loss
 of productivity. 

Our dependence on
petroleum-based products increases our costs as the prices of such products
increase, which c ould adversely
affect our business, operating results and financial
condition.

lawsuits brought in the United States District Court of the Eastern District of
Louisiana by or on behalf of the residents and landowners of New Orleans,
Louisiana and surrounding areas. While not technically class actions, the individual claims
and lawsuits are being prosecuted in a manner similar to that employed for
federal class actions. The claims are based on flooding and related
damage from Hurricane Katrina. In general, the claimants state that the flooding
and related damage resulted from the failure of certain aspects of the levee
system constructed by the Corps of Engineers, and the claimants seek recovery of
alleged general and special damages. 

The Corps
of Engineers has contracted with various private dredging companies, including
us, to perform maintenance dredging of the waterways.","['As you know, tropical storm Edouard made landfall east of Galveston, Texas on Tuesday morning and involved winds in excess of 60 mph and heavy rain.

 We are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, as well as potential environmental liabilities, which may require us to make substantial expenditures. 
 
 Our operations and properties are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and workplace health and safety. As an owner or operator of real property, or generator of waste, we could become subject to liability for environmental contamination, regardless of whether we caused such contamination. Certain environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs, without regard to fault, on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment. In addition, we could become liable to third parties for damages resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. From time to time, we could be subject to requests for information, notices of violation, and/or investigations initiated by environmental regulatory agencies relating to our operations and properties. Violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations, and facility shutdowns. Environmental and health and safety laws may change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time. As a result, we could incur costs for past, present, or future failure to comply with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, we could become subject to potential regulations concerning the emission of greenhouse gases, and while the effect of such future regulations cannot be determined at this time, they could require us to incur substantial costs in order to achieve and maintain compliance. In the ordinary course of business, we may be held responsible for any environmental damages we may cause to our customers' premises.

 Seasonality 
 Lower Lakes operates in a cyclical industry, primarily due to the typical cold weather patterns on the Great Lakes from December through March which cause lock closures, waterway ice, and customer facility closings, which typically shut down shipping for a period of up to 90 days commencing from late December to mid-January, and continuing until late March. Lower Lakes also experiences a cyclical pattern for its capital spending cycle, typically off-season from the shipping revenues, to permit annual maintenance and investment in the vessels. 
 The management of financial, general and administrative elements involved in the conduct of our business and ownership of our vessels requires the following main components: 
 
 management of our financial resources, including banking relationships (e.g., administration of bank loans); 
 
 management of our accounting system and records and financial reporting; 
 
 administration of the legal and regulatory requirements affecting our business and assets; and

 Critical accounting policies 
 Rand s significant accounting policies are presented in Note 2 to its audited consolidated financial statements, and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on Form 10-K.","Our failure to obtain the funds for necessary future capital expenditures and winter work expenses would limit our ability to continue to operate some of our vessels and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The climate in the Great Lakes region limits Lower Lakes vessel operations to approximately nine months per year. 
 Lower Lakes operating business is seasonal, meaning that it experiences higher levels of activity in some periods of the year than in others. Ordinarily, Lower Lakes is able to operate its vessels on the Great Lakes for approximately nine months per year beginning in late March or April and continuing through December or mid-January. However, weather conditions and customer demand cause increases and decreases in the number of days Lower Lakes actually operates. 
 The shipping industry has inherent operational risks that may not be adequately covered by Lower Lakes insurance. 
 Lower Lakes maintains insurance on its fleet for risks commonly insured against by vessel owners and operators, including hull and machinery insurance, war risks insurance and protection and indemnity insurance (which includes environmental damage and pollution insurance). Lower Lakes does not, however, insure the loss of a vessel s income when it is being repaired due to an insured hull and machinery claim. Adverse economic, political, social or other developments could decrease demand and growth in the shipping industry and thereby reduce revenue and earnings. Fluctuations, and the demand for vessels, in general, have been influenced by, among other factors: 
 o 
 global and regional economic conditions; 
 o 
 developments in international and Great Lakes trade; 
 10 

o 
 changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, such as port congestion and canal closures; 
 o 
 weather, water levels and crop yields; 
 o 
 political developments; and 
 o 
 embargoes and strikes. 
 The market values of Lower Lakes and Black Creek s vessels may decrease, which could cause Lower Lakes or Black Creek to breach covenants in their respective credit facilities, which could reduce earnings and revenues as a result of potential foreclosures. 
 Vessel values are influenced by several factors, including: 
 o 
 changes in environmental and other regulations that may limit the useful life of vessels; 
 o 
 changes in Great Lakes dry bulk commodity supply and demand; 
 o 
 types and sizes of vessels; 
 o 
 development of and increase in use of other modes of transportation; 
 o 
 governmental or other regulations; and 
 o 
 prevailing level of contract of affreightment rates and charter rates. 
 If the market values of Lower Lakes or Black Creek s owned vessels decrease, Lower Lakes or Black Creek may breach some of the covenants contained in their respective credit facilities. In the event that Lower Lakes were to lose the use of any of its vessels, our financial performance would be adversely affected. 
 Lower Lakes is subject to environmental laws that could require significant expenditures both to maintain compliance with such laws and to pay for any uninsured environmental liabilities resulting from a spill or other environmental disaster. 
 The shipping business and vessel operations are materially affected by government regulation in the form of international conventions, United States and Canadian treaties, national, state, provincial, and local laws, and regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which vessels operate. Pursuant to this Convention, the shipowner can limit its liability to (i) 1 million Special Drawing Right, or SDR, as defined by the International Monetary Fund for the first 2,000 tons of tonnage, (ii) 400 SDR for each additional ton up to 30,000 tons of tonnage, (iii) 300 SDR for each additional ton up to 70,000 tons of tonnage and (iv) 200 SDR for each additional ton of tonnage. In addition to the Marine Liability Act, Lower Lakes vessels are also subject to 
 12 

other Canadian laws and regulations that contain significant fine and penalty provisions relating to the marine environment, pollution and discharges of hazardous substances, including the Migratory Birds Convention Act, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, and the Fisheries Act. 
 The United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills. Although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of fuel, it is impossible to predict the price of fuel. Political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries (including, but not limited to, recent political unrest the Middle East), changes in government policy, changes in fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and additional fuel price increases in the future. There can be no assurance that Lower Lakes will be able to fully recover its increased fuel costs by passing these costs on to its customers. 
 The operation of Great Lakes-going vessels entails the possibility of marine disasters including damage or destruction of the vessel due to accident, the loss of a vessel due to piracy or terrorism, damage or destruction of cargo and similar events that may cause a loss of revenue from affected vessels and damage Lower Lakes business reputation, which may in turn, lead to loss of business. 
 The operation of Great Lakes-going vessels entails certain inherent risks that may adversely affect Lower Lakes business and reputation, including: 
 o 
 damage or destruction of a vessel due to marine disaster such as a collision; 
 o 
 the loss of a vessel due to piracy and terrorism; 
 o 
 cargo and property losses or damage as a result of the foregoing or less drastic causes such as human error, mechanical failure, low water levels and bad weather; 
 o 
 environmental accidents as a result of the foregoing; and 
 13 

o 
 business interruptions and delivery delays caused by mechanical failure, human error, war, terrorism, political action in various countries, labor strikes or adverse weather conditions. 
 Any of these circumstances or events could substantially increase Lower Lakes costs, as for example, the costs of replacing a vessel or cleaning up a spill, or lower its revenues by taking vessels out of operation permanently or for periods of time.","['Marine freight revenue per sailing day decreased by $2,203 or 7.4% to $27,480 per sailing day, compared to $29,683 per sailing day during the same year-ago period.

Added financial stress on our clients could lead to their acquisition or bankruptcy, which could cause the termination of some of our service relationships. Further, despite the cost benefits that we believe our services provide, prospective clients may wish to delay contract decisions due to implementation costs or be reluctant to make any material changes in their established business methods in the current economic climate. With a reduction in tax revenue, state and federal government healthcare programs, including reimbursement programs such as Medicaid or initiatives under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which we refer to as the ACA, may be reduced or eliminated, which could negatively impact the payments that our clients receive. 
 The ability to access our systems is critical to our clients administration of care, cash flow, and business viability. Our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (i) power loss and telecommunications failures; (ii) earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane, and other natural disasters; (iii) terrorism and acts of war; (iv) software and hardware errors, failures, or crashes in our systems or those of others; and (v) computer viruses, hacking, and similar disruptive problems in our systems or those of others. We attempt to mitigate these risks through various means, including redundant infrastructure, disaster recovery plans, business continuity plans, separate test systems, and change control and system security measures, but our precautions will not protect against all potential problems. 
 In addition to the services we provide from our offices, we serve our clients primarily from third-party data-hosting facilities. These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at two or more of the facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our services could be interrupted. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users or clients. To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against: 
 
 damage from fire, power loss, and other natural disasters; 
 
 communications failures; 
 
 software and hardware errors, failures, and crashes;

Net losses and LAE decreased by 1.8 million , or 4.5 , fo r the year ended December 31, 2015 , as compared to the same period in 2014 . The decrease in our net losses and LAE was attributable to a number of factors, including a significant reduction in weather-related property losses which were historically high in 2014, a decrease in losses in low-value dwelling resulting from our underwriting changes in late 2014, and an increase in ceded losses under the quota share reinsurance agreement. Partially offsetting these items were increases to net losses and LAE due to increases in the overall growth of our business as well as the strengthening of our commercial automobile reserves and losses in our run-off personal automobile line of business. The 11.8 percentage point decrease in the loss ratio was mainly the result of lower losses in the low-value dwelling and commercial multi-peril lines. Both lines experienced losses that were historically higher in 2014 due to weather-related property damage. In addition, the mix of business continues to evolve as our lines of business with historically lower overall loss ratios grow (such as wind-exposed homeowners, and commercial liability lines), and the historically higher loss ratio businesses decline (such as low-value dwelling in the Midwest and nonstandard automobile).","We base our estimates on our assessment of known facts and circumstances, as well as estimates of future trends in claim severity, claim frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both internal and external events that could increase our exposure to losses, including changes in actuarial projections, claims handling procedures, inflation, severe weather, climate change, economic and judicial trends, and legislative changes. We continually monitor reserves using new information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques to update our current estimate. 
 Among the uncertainties we encounter in establishing our reserves for losses and related expenses in connection with our insurance businesses are as follows: 
 
 When we write occurrence policies, we are obligated to pay covered claims, up to the contractually agreed amount, for any covered loss that occurs while the policy is in force. Accordingly, claims may arise many years after a policy has lapsed; 
 
 Even when a claim is received (irrespective of whether the policy is a ""claims-made , which requires claims to be reported during the policy period, or occurrence basis form), it may take considerable time to fully appreciate the extent of the covered loss suffered by the insured and, consequently, estimates of loss associated with specific claims can increase over time; 
 
 New theories of liability are enforced retroactively from time to time by courts; 
 
 Volatility in the financial markets, economic events, weather events and other external factors may result in an increase in the number of claims and the severity of the claims reported. In addition, elevated inflationary conditions would, among other things, drive loss costs to increase; 
 
 If claims became more frequent, even if we had no liability for those claims, the cost of evaluating these potential claims could escalate beyond the amount of the reserves we have established. Future loss experience substantially in excess of established reserves could also have a material adverse effect on future earnings and liquidity and financial rating, which would affect our ability to attract business and could affect our ability to retain or hire qualified personnel.

Severe weather conditions and other catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and financial condition. 
 Our property insurance business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including natural events such as hurricanes, winter weather, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe thunderstorms, fires and other non-natural events such as explosions or riots. Additionally, as we continue to grow our homeowners line of business in Florida, Hawaii, Texas and other catastrophe exposed states, our risks related to hurricanes and other tropical storms increase. 
 The incidence and severity of catastrophes and severe weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Severe weather conditions and catastrophes can cause greater losses in our property lines and cause our liquidity and financial condition to deteriorate. In addition, our inability to obtain reinsurance coverage at reasonable rates and in amounts adequate to mitigate the risks associated with severe weather conditions and other catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation. 
 Part of our growth strategy involves expansion into areas with a history of severe catastrophic events, the occurrence of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Part of our growth strategy has involved expanding our specialty property and casualty lines of business into states such as Hawaii, Florida, and Texas that have historically experienced severe catastrophic events such as hurricanes, tornados, and other severe weather events. Generally, while we believe that geographic diversification and disciplined underwriting will mitigate our overall exposure, severe weather events are inherently unpredictable. Contemporaneous or near contemporaneous catastrophic events across these geographies, each of which has a history of severe catastrophic events, would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, as a result of current industry non-weather factors, such as the increase in litigation surrounding the Assignment of Benefits claims and lawsuits in Florida, in particular, we began significantly reducing our overall homeowners' exposure in Florida. 
 The property and casualty insurance business is historically cyclical in nature, and we may experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates, which could adversely affect our business. The U.S. federal government generally has not directly regulated the insurance industry except for certain areas of the market, such as insurance for flood, nuclear and terrorism risks. However, the federal government has undertaken initiatives or considered legislation in several areas that may affect the insurance industry, including tort reform and corporate governance. 
 The effect of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business is uncertain. 
 As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either broadening coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond the underwriting intent or by increasing the size or number of claims. 
 In addition, we design our E S lines policy terms to manage our exposure to expanding theories of legal liability like those which have given rise to claims for lead paint, asbestos, mold, construction defects and environmental matters. Many of the policies we issue also include conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims to us and entitle us to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition. We have established security policies, processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations. Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions. 
 Despite these efforts, our systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. 
 Our geographic concentration ties our performance to the business, economic, natural perils, man-made perils, and regulatory conditions within our most concentrated region. 
 Our revenues and profitability are subject to the prevailing regulatory, legal, economic, political, demographic, competitive, weather and other conditions in the principal states in which we do business. Changes in any of these conditions could make it less attractive for us to do business in such states and would have a more pronounced effect on us compared to companies that are more geographically diversified. In addition, our exposure to severe losses from localized perils, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, wind, ice storms, hail, fires, terrorism, riots and explosions, is increased in those areas where we have written significant numbers of insurance policies.

 Catastrophe Losses from Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma 
 We have recorded pre-tax losses and reinsurance reinstatement costs during the third quarter ended September 30, 2017, of approximately 5.6 million, net of expected reinsurance recoveries, for catastrophe losses related to two category 4 hurricanes, Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Hurricane Irma in Florida. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 In certain circumstances, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. This was primarily due to adverse development of 865,000 from the commercial liability line of business, 697,000 from the Florida homeowners line, 604,000 from the commercial auto line of business, 350,000 from the commercial property line, offset by 446,000 of favorable development from other lines. Incurred losses during the three months ended September 30, 2017 also included 5.0 million in net catastrophe losses in the current accident year related to Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. The calendar year and accident year loss ratios have increased by 84 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 , as compared to the same period in 2016 due to the increased losses previously mentioned, but also due to lower net earned premiums in the third quarter of 2017. In September 2017, 7.2 million of ceded premium related to the ADC (a one-time charge) and 600,000 of ceded premiums for reinstatement costs of catastrophe reinsurance related to Hurricane Irma. 
 Total reserve development on prior accident years in the third quarter of 2016 was unfavorable by 2.6 million , or 11.0 percentage points. The increase in the ratio was mainly due to decreased net earned premium. In September 2017, 7.2 million was ceded to the ADC (a one-time charge) and 600,000 was ceded as reinstatement costs of catastrophe reinsurance relating to Hurricane Irma. Before these two costs, the expense ratio continued to decline to 42.9 in the third quarter. 
 Net written premiums decreased 9.1 million , or 12.4 , to 63.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 , as compared to 72.9 million for the same period in 2016 . The decrease is primarily related to the 7.2 million ceded written premium and 600,000 of reinstatement premium recorded in the third quarter related to the ADC and Hurricane Irma, respectively. The remainder of the decrease in net written premium is due to an increase in catastrophe reinsurance costs beginning in June 2016. The calendar year loss ratios were 87.2 and 61.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Before the impact of the ADC and hurricane costs, the calendar year and accident year loss ratios were 78.4 and 59.1 , respectively. 
 Overall reserve development on prior accident years for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was 9.4 million of adverse development, or 14.0 percentage points on the loss ratio. This was due to reserve development in the commercial liability line of 4.2 million, 2.2 million in the commercial property line, 2.4 million in the Florida homeowners line, 900,000 in the commercial automobile line, offset by 280,000 of favorable development in other lines. Third quarter incurred losses also include 5.0 million in net catastrophe losses in the current accident year related to Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. The calendar year and accident year loss ratios have increased by 25.3 and 19.8 percentage points, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 , as compared to the same period in 2016 due to the increased losses previously mentioned, but also due to lower net earned premiums in the third quarter of 2017. In September 2017, 7.2 million of ceded premiums related to the ADC (a one-time charge) and 600,000 of ceded premiums for reinstatement costs of catastrophe reinsurance related to Hurricane Irma. 
 Total adverse reserve development on prior accident years for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 , was 5.7 million , or 8.5 percentage points. The increase in the ratio was mainly due to decreased net earned premium. In September 2017, 7.2 million was ceded to the ADC (a one-time charge) and 600,000 was ceded as reinstatement costs of catastrophe reinsurance relating to Hurricane Irma. Before these two costs, the expense ratio declined 4.3 percentage points to 43.7 , compared to the same period in 2016.",,"[""As the financial results and balance sheet information is fully detailed in our press release and quarterly filings, I will briefly go over a few highlights, but welcome any specific questions during Q&A.The net premiums earned for the third quarter decreased 25% to $17.7 million compared to $23.4 million in the prior-year period.

ability to open new stores on a timely and cost-effective basis, or at all, is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our ability to: 

find quality locations; 

reach acceptable agreements regarding the lease or purchase of locations; 

comply with applicable zoning, licensing, land use and environmental regulations; 

raise or have available an adequate amount of cash or currently available financing for construction and opening costs; 

timely hire, train and retain the skilled management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs; 

obtain, for acceptable cost, required permits and approvals, including liquor licenses; and 

efficiently manage the amount of time and money used to build and open each new store. If we
succeed in opening new stores on a timely and cost-effective basis, we may nonetheless be unable to attract enough customers to new stores because potential customers may be unfamiliar with our stores or concept, or our entertainment and menu
options might not appeal to them. For example, the number of days between
Thanksgiving and New Year s Day and the days of the week on which Christmas and New Year s Eve fall affect the volume of business we generate during the December holiday season and can affect our results for the full fiscal year. In
addition, adverse weather during the winter and spring seasons can have a significant impact on our first and fourth quarters, and therefore our results for the full fiscal year. 
 Our operating results may also fluctuate significantly because of non-seasonal factors. 
 Changes in laws, regulations and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 We are also subject to federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and other requirements. More stringent and varied requirements
of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new stores in particular locations. Environmental laws and regulations also govern, among other things,
discharges of pollutants into the air and water as well as the presence, handling, release and disposal of and exposure to hazardous substances. These laws provide for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance. Third parties may also make
personal injury, property damage or other claims against us associated with actual or alleged release of, or exposure to, hazardous substances at our properties. We could also be strictly liable, without regard to fault, for certain environmental
conditions at properties we formerly owned or operated as well as at our current properties. We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards
Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages and overtime), along with the Americans with Disabilities Act, various family leave mandates and other federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern working conditions. The imposition of menu-labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as the hospitality industry in general. 
 Our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected by climate change and the passage of other environmental legislation and
regulations. The costs and other effects of new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. For example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent that such
requirements increase prices charged to us by vendors because of increased compliance costs. At this point, we are unable to determine the impact that climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations could have on our overall
business. We face potential liability with our gift cards under the property laws of some states. In addition, we have not purchased
life insurance on any members of our senior management. Local conditions, events, terrorist attacks, adverse weather conditions and natural
disasters could adversely affect our business. Certain of the regions in which our stores are located have been, and may in the
future be, subject to adverse local conditions, events, terrorist attacks, adverse weather conditions, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes. For example, our nine stores located in California and our one store located in
Oregon are particularly subject to earthquake risk, and our five stores in Florida, our three stores in Houston, Texas and our one store in Hawaii are particularly subject to hurricane risk. Depending upon its magnitude, a natural disaster could
severely damage our stores, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our corporate headquarters, company-owned distribution center, game repair facility and our data center, as well as our backup data
facility are all located in Dallas, Texas.","[""But in general, how Christmas shifting for the weekend is not good for us.

,"Furthermore, although we are implementing a strategic sourcing initiative, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings from that initiative. In addition, because we maintain limited raw material and component inventories, even brief unanticipated delays in delivery by suppliers - including those due to capacity constraints, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of suppliers, weather emergencies or other natural disasters - may impair our ability to satisfy our customers and could adversely affect our financial performance. 
 To better manage our exposures to certain commodity price fluctuations, we regularly hedge our commodity exposures through financial markets. High quality foodservice equipment can help these providers meet this challenge. Additionally, restaurants are striving to reduce waste and promote sustainability. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, approximately one third of all food produced globally gets either lost or wasted each year. 
 In 2016, cash contributions by us to all pension plans, including the multiemployer plan, were 6.1 million , and we estimate that our pension plan contributions will be approximately 10.0 million in 2017.

17. Contingencies and Significant Estimates 
 As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company held reserves for environmental matters related to certain locations of approximately 0.5 million and 0.4 million , respectively. At certain of the Company's other facilities, it has identified potential contaminants in soil and groundwater. Based upon available information, the Company does not expect the ultimate costs at any of these locations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows individually or in the aggregate. 
 The Company believes that it has obtained and is in substantial compliance with those material environmental permits and approvals necessary to conduct its various businesses. Based on the facts presently known, the Company does not expect environmental compliance costs to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 As of December 31, 2016 , various product-related lawsuits were pending. See Note 18, ""Product Warranties,"" for further information. 
 It is reasonably possible that the estimates for environmental remediation, product liability and warranty costs may change in the near future based upon new information that may arise or matters that are beyond the scope of the Company's historical experience. Presently, there are no reliable methods to estimate the amount of any such potential changes.","[""And if I could just ask one follow-up on the quarter.

First Quarter 2011 Compared to First Quarter 2010 

While our coated products division drove the increase in sales during the 2011 quarter, our threaded products division was responsible for the increase in gross profit and gross margin. The improvement in coated products net sales is due to the 2010 period being impacted unfavorably by a recessionary climate which reduced market demand. Our threaded products division s growth in gross profit and gross margin came from increased volumes which reduced unfavorable manufacturing expenses.

 Royalty litigation 
 In October 2011, a potential class of royalty interest owners in New Mexico and Colorado filed a complaint against us in the County of Rio Arriba, New Mexico. The complaint presently alleges failure to pay royalty on hydrocarbons including drip condensate, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent concealment, conversion, misstatement of the value of gas and affiliated sales, breach of duty to market hydrocarbons in Colorado, breach of implied duty to market, violation of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Proceeds Payment Act, and bad faith breach of contract. Plaintiffs sought monetary damages and a declaratory judgment enjoining activities relating to production, payments and future reporting. However, the timing of any such guidance is uncertain and, independent of the issuance of additional guidance, ONRR asked producers to attempt to evaluate the deductibility of these fees directly with the midstream companies that transport and process gas. 
 Environmental matters 
 The Environmental Protection Agency EPA ), other federal agencies, and various state and local regulatory agencies and jurisdictions routinely promulgate and propose new rules, and issue updated guidance to existing rules. These new rules and rulemakings include, but are not limited to, new air quality standards for ground level ozone, methane, green completions, and hydraulic fracturing and water standards. The indemnities provided to the purchasers are customary in sale transactions and are contingent upon the purchasers incurring liabilities that are not otherwise recoverable from third parties. The indemnities generally relate to breaches of representations and warranties, tax liabilities, historic litigation, personal injury, environmental matters and rights-of-way. The indemnity provided to the purchaser of the entity that held our Piceance Basin operations relates in substantial part to liabilities arising in connection with litigation over the appropriate calculation of royalty payments.","[""At 204 million cubic feet per day, our natural gas production for the third quarter was approximately flat versus the same quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of this year.

All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth above. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, canceled or rendered unprofitable or less profitable than anticipated as a result of a variety of other factors, including: 
 
 26 

increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment, supplies, skilled labor, capital or transportation; 
 
 equipment failures or accidents; 
 
 adverse weather conditions, such as floods or blizzards; 
 
 title and lease related problems; 
 
 limitations in the market for oil and natural gas; 
 
 unexpected drilling conditions or problems; 
 
 pressure or irregularities in geological formations; 
 
 regulations and regulatory approvals; 
 
 changes or anticipated changes in energy prices; or 
 
 compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements. 
 If oil and natural gas prices decrease, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas oil properties. 
 Reserve estimation is a subjective process of evaluating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Reserves that are proved reserves are those estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and relate to projects for which the extraction of hydrocarbons must have commenced or for which the operator is reasonably certain will commence within a reasonable time. 
 The process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. 
 The markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs are likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control, including: 
 
 weather conditions; 
 
 the level of consumer demand; 
 
 the overall economic environment; 
 
 worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs; 
 
 turmoil in the Middle East and other producing regions; 
 
 28 

the activities of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; 
 
 terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets; 
 
 variations in local market conditions (basis differential); 
 
 the price and availability of other types of fuels; 
 
 the availability of pipeline capacity; 
 
 supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; 
 
 the price and quantity of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; 
 
 domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; 
 
 volatility in the oil and natural gas markets; 
 
 the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold; and 
 
 the adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate change. 
 Our business depends on access to oil, natural gas and NGL transportation systems and facilities. 
 Our ability to acquire additional drilling locations and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which they may not be adequately insured. 
 There are operational risks associated with drilling for, production, gathering, transporting, storage, processing and treating of oil and natural gas and the fractionation and storage of NGLs, including: 
 
 hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, extreme weather conditions and other natural disasters; 
 
 aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; 
 
 damages to pipelines, pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions; 
 
 31 

uncontrolled releases of oil, natural gas (including sour gas), NGLs, brine or industrial chemicals; 
 
 operator error; 
 
 pollution and environmental risks; 
 
 fires, explosions and blowouts; 
 
 risks related to truck and rail loading and unloading; and 
 
 terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies. 
 Any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. 
 We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims. 
 We are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business, including environmental accidents. We do not maintain insurance in the type and amount to cover all possible risks of loss. As a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. 
 Our significant indebtedness reduces our financial flexibility and could impede our ability to operate. The sales price per share of our common stock has traded as low as 12.60 since December 31, 2016. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to the following events or factors that may vary over time and some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to: 
 
 changes in oil and natural gas prices, including in different geographic locations; 
 
 demand for oil and natural gas; 
 
 the success of our drilling program; 
 
 changes in our drilling schedule; 
 
 adjustments to our reserve estimates and differences between actual and estimated production, revenue and expenditures; 
 
 competition from other oil and gas companies; 
 
 costs and liabilities relating to governmental laws and regulations and environmental risks; 
 
 general market, political and economic conditions; 
 
 our failure to meet financial analysts performance or financing expectations; 
 
 changes in recommendations by financial analysts; and 
 
 changes in market valuations of other companies in our industry. 
 In particular, a significant or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our results of operations, our access to capital and the quantities of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. 
 We are subject to risks associated with climate change. 
 There is a growing belief that emissions of GHGs may be linked to climate change. Climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts and the regulation of GHGs have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including negatively impacting the costs we incur in providing our products and services, the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, all of which can create financial risks. 
 
 34 

In addition, legislative and regulatory responses related to GHGs and climate change create the potential for financial risk. Numerous states have announced or adopted programs to stabilize and reduce GHGs, as well as their own reporting requirements. On September 22, 2009, the EPA finalized a GHG reporting rule that requires large sources of GHG emissions to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their GHG emissions. On November 8, 2010, the EPA also issued GHG monitoring and reporting regulations specifically for oil and natural gas facilities, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year-the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The rule requires annual reporting of GHG emissions by regulated facilities to the EPA. We are required to report our GHG emissions to the EPA each year in March under this rule, and the EPA publishes the data on its website. The EPA has also enacted permitting requirements for GHG emissions under the CAA for certain stationary sources and newer modification projects. In March 2014, the White House published the President s Climate Action Plan Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions. In August 2015, EPA issued a suite of proposed regulations applicable to the oil and gas sector to decrease methane emissions. There have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of GHGs. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more state, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate GHG emissions. 
 The actions of the EPA and the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions program. If we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. 
 Our operations are subject to governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities that could exceed current expectations. 
 Substantial costs, liabilities, delays and other significant issues could arise from environmental laws and regulations affecting drilling and well completion, gathering, transportation, and storage, and we may incur substantial costs and liabilities in the performance of these types of operations. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, the discharge of materials into the environment and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. These laws include: 
 
 Clean Air Act CAA and analogous state laws, which impose obligations related to air emissions; 
 
 Clean Water Act CWA ), and analogous state laws, which regulate discharge of wastewaters and storm water from some our facilities into state and federal waters, including wetlands; 
 
 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act CERCLA ), and analogous state laws, which regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal; 
 
 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA ), and analogous state laws, which impose requirements for the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities; 
 
 National Environmental Policy Act NEPA ), which requires federal agencies to study likely environmental impacts of a proposed federal action before it is approved, such as drilling on federal lands; 
 
 Safe Drinking Water Act SDWA ), which restricts the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development; 
 
 Endangered Species Act ESA ), and analogous state laws, which seek to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animals, fish and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species; and 
 
 Oil Pollution Act OPA of 1990, which requires oil storage facilities and vessels to submit to the federal government plans detailing how they will respond to large discharges, requires updates to technology and equipment, regulation of above ground storage tanks and sets forth liability for spills by responsible parties. 
 Various governmental authorities, including the EPA, the U.S. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, delays in granting permits and cancellation of leases. 
 
 35 

There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our business, some of which may be material, due to the handling of our products as they are gathered, transported, processed and stored, air emissions related to our operations, historical industry operations, and water and waste disposal practices. Joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, including CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of oil, natural gas and wastes on, under, or from our properties and facilities. Private parties may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. In addition, Non-Governmental Organizations who oppose the development of fossil fuels for a number of reasons, including environmental concerns, have recently increased their activities in ways outside the normal legal process by staging protests and demonstrations in a way that may disrupt our ability to conduct our operations and market our production. To date, most of this activity has been related to issues associated with the development of infrastructure but the possibility exists that these activities could be directed to other aspects of our business. In addition, increasingly strict laws, regulations and enforcement policies could materially increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us. 
 In March 2010, the EPA announced its National Enforcement Initiatives for 2011 to 2013, which were extended by the EPA for fiscal years 2014 to 2016 and now through 2019, which include Energy Extraction and Ensuring Energy Extraction Activities Comply with Environmental Laws. The EPA has settled a number of high-impact cases under this initiative resulting in significant air emissions reductions, and will continue to identify the best ways to address pollution through greater use of advanced pollution monitoring and reporting techniques. This initiative could involve a large scale investigation of our facilities and processes, and could lead to potential enforcement actions, penalties or injunctive relief against us. 
 Our business may be adversely affected by increased costs due to stricter pollution control equipment requirements or liabilities resulting from non-compliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. Also, we might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for our operations. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation or construction of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs. 
 We are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. 
 We make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretations of those laws and regulations. If the interpretation of laws or regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our assumptions may change, and new capital costs may be incurred to comply with such changes. In addition, new environmental laws and regulations might adversely affect our products and activities, including drilling, processing, storage and transportation, as well as waste management and air emissions. For instance, the Obama administration issued a suite of proposed regulations to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector in August 2015 to petroleum-sector methane emissions 40 to 45 percent by 2025 from 2012 levels. EPA issued its proposed rules for new and modified wells in 2015 and finalized them in 2016. We find that the use of hydraulic fracturing is necessary to produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas from many reservoirs. Recently, there has been heightened debate about the hydraulic fracturing process and proposals have been made to revisit the environmental exemption for hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or to enact separate federal legislation or legislation at the state and local government levels that would regulate hydraulic fracturing. If adopted, 
 
 36 

this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal, state or local levels, and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment, including groundwater, soil or surface water. Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways, with the EPA having finalized a multi-year study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The EPA published its Final Assessment of the Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas on Drinking Water Resources on December 13, 2016. If new federal or state laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities, make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business as well as delay or prevent the development of unconventional gas resources from shale formations which are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing. 
 Our ability to produce oil and natural gas could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling and completion operations or are unable to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules. 
 Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations, could adversely impact our operations in our Delaware Basin, San Juan Basin and Williston Basin operations. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. The CWA imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into navigable waters. Many state discharge regulations and the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System general permits issued by the EPA prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the natural gas and oil industry into coastal waters. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. In August 2015, the EPA published its Final 2014 Effluent Guidelines Program Plans under the CWA confirming its intention to regulate wastewater discharges from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction and to specifically investigate centralized water treatment facilities that accept oil and gas extraction wastewaters. Compliance with current and future environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted. 
 Legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry, and the complex government regulations to which our businesses are subject, have adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. In addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation or increased permitting requirements. 
 
 37 

Current legal proceedings or other matters against us, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, challenges to our permits by citizen groups and similar matters, might result in adverse decisions against us. The result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, BLM and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, along with each Native American tribe, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American tribal lands. These regulations and approval requirements relate to such matters as lease provisions, drilling and production requirements, environmental standards and royalty considerations. In addition, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. However, suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable. The following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions, including any completed or future acquisitions: 
 
 some of the acquired businesses or properties may not produce revenues, reserves, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels or could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; 
 
 we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or that exceed our estimates; 
 
 properties we acquire may be subject to burdens on title that we were not aware of at the time of acquisition or that interfere with our ability to hold the property for production; 
 
 38 

we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; 
 
 acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures; and 
 
 we may issue additional equity or debt securities related to future acquisitions. 
 Substantial acquisitions or other transactions could require significant external capital and could change our risk and property profile. The expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to similar losses of institutional knowledge or disruptions. 
 Our assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. 
 Our assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme temperatures. Insurance may be inadequate, and in some instances, it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. A significant disruption in operations or a significant liability for which we were not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our customers energy needs vary with weather conditions. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change or demand is impacted by regulations associated with climate change, customers energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes, leading either to increased investment or decreased revenues. 
 Acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to the ability to produce, process, transport or distribute oil, natural gas, or NGLs. Acts of terrorism as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs. 
 We may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial health, and may decrease our profitability. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, canceled or rendered unprofitable or less profitable than anticipated as a result of a variety of other factors, including: 
 
 26 

increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment, supplies, skilled labor, capital or transportation; 
 
 equipment failures or accidents; 
 
 adverse weather conditions, such as floods or blizzards; 
 
 title and lease related problems; 
 
 limitations in the market for oil and natural gas; 
 
 unexpected drilling conditions or problems; 
 
 pressure or irregularities in geological formations; 
 
 regulations and regulatory approvals; 
 
 changes or anticipated changes in energy prices; or 
 
 compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements. 
 If oil and natural gas prices decrease, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas oil properties. 
 Reserve estimation is a subjective process of evaluating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Reserves that are proved reserves are those estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and relate to projects for which the extraction of hydrocarbons must have commenced or for which the operator is reasonably certain will commence within a reasonable time. 
 The process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. 
 The markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs are likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control, including: 
 
 weather conditions; 
 
 the level of consumer demand; 
 
 the overall economic environment; 
 
 worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs; 
 
 turmoil in the Middle East and other producing regions; 
 
 28 

the activities of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; 
 
 terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets; 
 
 variations in local market conditions (basis differential); 
 
 the price and availability of other types of fuels; 
 
 the availability of pipeline capacity; 
 
 supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions; 
 
 the price and quantity of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; 
 
 domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; 
 
 volatility in the oil and natural gas markets; 
 
 the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold; and 
 
 the adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate change. 
 Our business depends on access to oil, natural gas and NGL transportation systems and facilities. 
 Our ability to acquire additional drilling locations and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which they may not be adequately insured. 
 There are operational risks associated with drilling for, production, gathering, transporting, storage, processing and treating of oil and natural gas and the fractionation and storage of NGLs, including: 
 
 hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, extreme weather conditions and other natural disasters; 
 
 aging infrastructure and mechanical problems; 
 
 damages to pipelines, pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions; 
 
 31 

uncontrolled releases of oil, natural gas (including sour gas), NGLs, brine or industrial chemicals; 
 
 operator error; 
 
 pollution and environmental risks; 
 
 fires, explosions and blowouts; 
 
 risks related to truck and rail loading and unloading; and 
 
 terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies. 
 Any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. 
 We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims. 
 We are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business, including environmental accidents. We do not maintain insurance in the type and amount to cover all possible risks of loss. As a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns. 
 Our significant indebtedness reduces our financial flexibility and could impede our ability to operate. The sales price per share of our common stock has traded as low as 12.60 since December 31, 2016. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to the following events or factors that may vary over time and some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to: 
 
 changes in oil and natural gas prices, including in different geographic locations; 
 
 demand for oil and natural gas; 
 
 the success of our drilling program; 
 
 changes in our drilling schedule; 
 
 adjustments to our reserve estimates and differences between actual and estimated production, revenue and expenditures; 
 
 competition from other oil and gas companies; 
 
 costs and liabilities relating to governmental laws and regulations and environmental risks; 
 
 general market, political and economic conditions; 
 
 our failure to meet financial analysts performance or financing expectations; 
 
 changes in recommendations by financial analysts; and 
 
 changes in market valuations of other companies in our industry. 
 In particular, a significant or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our results of operations, our access to capital and the quantities of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. 
 We are subject to risks associated with climate change. 
 There is a growing belief that emissions of GHGs may be linked to climate change. Climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts and the regulation of GHGs have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including negatively impacting the costs we incur in providing our products and services, the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, all of which can create financial risks. 
 
 34 

In addition, legislative and regulatory responses related to GHGs and climate change create the potential for financial risk. Numerous states have announced or adopted programs to stabilize and reduce GHGs, as well as their own reporting requirements. On September 22, 2009, the EPA finalized a GHG reporting rule that requires large sources of GHG emissions to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their GHG emissions. On November 8, 2010, the EPA also issued GHG monitoring and reporting regulations specifically for oil and natural gas facilities, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year-the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The rule requires annual reporting of GHG emissions by regulated facilities to the EPA. We are required to report our GHG emissions to the EPA each year in March under this rule, and the EPA publishes the data on its website. The EPA has also enacted permitting requirements for GHG emissions under the CAA for certain stationary sources and newer modification projects. In March 2014, the White House published the President s Climate Action Plan Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions. In August 2015, EPA issued a suite of proposed regulations applicable to the oil and gas sector to decrease methane emissions. There have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of GHGs. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more state, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate GHG emissions. 
 The actions of the EPA and the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions program. If we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. 
 Our operations are subject to governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities that could exceed current expectations. 
 Substantial costs, liabilities, delays and other significant issues could arise from environmental laws and regulations affecting drilling and well completion, gathering, transportation, and storage, and we may incur substantial costs and liabilities in the performance of these types of operations. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, the discharge of materials into the environment and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. These laws include: 
 
 Clean Air Act CAA and analogous state laws, which impose obligations related to air emissions; 
 
 Clean Water Act CWA ), and analogous state laws, which regulate discharge of wastewaters and storm water from some our facilities into state and federal waters, including wetlands; 
 
 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act CERCLA ), and analogous state laws, which regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal; 
 
 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA ), and analogous state laws, which impose requirements for the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities; 
 
 National Environmental Policy Act NEPA ), which requires federal agencies to study likely environmental impacts of a proposed federal action before it is approved, such as drilling on federal lands; 
 
 Safe Drinking Water Act SDWA ), which restricts the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development; 
 
 Endangered Species Act ESA ), and analogous state laws, which seek to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animals, fish and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species; and 
 
 Oil Pollution Act OPA of 1990, which requires oil storage facilities and vessels to submit to the federal government plans detailing how they will respond to large discharges, requires updates to technology and equipment, regulation of above ground storage tanks and sets forth liability for spills by responsible parties. 
 Various governmental authorities, including the EPA, the U.S. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, delays in granting permits and cancellation of leases. 
 
 35 

There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our business, some of which may be material, due to the handling of our products as they are gathered, transported, processed and stored, air emissions related to our operations, historical industry operations, and water and waste disposal practices. Joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, including CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of oil, natural gas and wastes on, under, or from our properties and facilities. Private parties may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. In addition, Non-Governmental Organizations who oppose the development of fossil fuels for a number of reasons, including environmental concerns, have recently increased their activities in ways outside the normal legal process by staging protests and demonstrations in a way that may disrupt our ability to conduct our operations and market our production. To date, most of this activity has been related to issues associated with the development of infrastructure but the possibility exists that these activities could be directed to other aspects of our business. In addition, increasingly strict laws, regulations and enforcement policies could materially increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us. 
 In March 2010, the EPA announced its National Enforcement Initiatives for 2011 to 2013, which were extended by the EPA for fiscal years 2014 to 2016 and now through 2019, which include Energy Extraction and Ensuring Energy Extraction Activities Comply with Environmental Laws. The EPA has settled a number of high-impact cases under this initiative resulting in significant air emissions reductions, and will continue to identify the best ways to address pollution through greater use of advanced pollution monitoring and reporting techniques. This initiative could involve a large scale investigation of our facilities and processes, and could lead to potential enforcement actions, penalties or injunctive relief against us. 
 Our business may be adversely affected by increased costs due to stricter pollution control equipment requirements or liabilities resulting from non-compliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. Also, we might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for our operations. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation or construction of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs. 
 We are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses. 
 We make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretations of those laws and regulations. If the interpretation of laws or regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our assumptions may change, and new capital costs may be incurred to comply with such changes. In addition, new environmental laws and regulations might adversely affect our products and activities, including drilling, processing, storage and transportation, as well as waste management and air emissions. For instance, the Obama administration issued a suite of proposed regulations to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector in August 2015 to petroleum-sector methane emissions 40 to 45 percent by 2025 from 2012 levels. EPA issued its proposed rules for new and modified wells in 2015 and finalized them in 2016. We find that the use of hydraulic fracturing is necessary to produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas from many reservoirs. Recently, there has been heightened debate about the hydraulic fracturing process and proposals have been made to revisit the environmental exemption for hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or to enact separate federal legislation or legislation at the state and local government levels that would regulate hydraulic fracturing. If adopted, 
 
 36 

this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal, state or local levels, and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment, including groundwater, soil or surface water. Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways, with the EPA having finalized a multi-year study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The EPA published its Final Assessment of the Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas on Drinking Water Resources on December 13, 2016. If new federal or state laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities, make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business as well as delay or prevent the development of unconventional gas resources from shale formations which are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing. 
 Our ability to produce oil and natural gas could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling and completion operations or are unable to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules. 
 Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations, could adversely impact our operations in our Delaware Basin, San Juan Basin and Williston Basin operations. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. The CWA imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into navigable waters. Many state discharge regulations and the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System general permits issued by the EPA prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the natural gas and oil industry into coastal waters. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. In August 2015, the EPA published its Final 2014 Effluent Guidelines Program Plans under the CWA confirming its intention to regulate wastewater discharges from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction and to specifically investigate centralized water treatment facilities that accept oil and gas extraction wastewaters. Compliance with current and future environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted. 
 Legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry, and the complex government regulations to which our businesses are subject, have adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. In addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation or increased permitting requirements. 
 
 37 

Current legal proceedings or other matters against us, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, challenges to our permits by citizen groups and similar matters, might result in adverse decisions against us. The result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, BLM and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, along with each Native American tribe, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American tribal lands. These regulations and approval requirements relate to such matters as lease provisions, drilling and production requirements, environmental standards and royalty considerations. In addition, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. However, suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable. The following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions, including any completed or future acquisitions: 
 
 some of the acquired businesses or properties may not produce revenues, reserves, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels or could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; 
 
 we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or that exceed our estimates; 
 
 properties we acquire may be subject to burdens on title that we were not aware of at the time of acquisition or that interfere with our ability to hold the property for production; 
 
 38 

we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; 
 
 acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures; and 
 
 we may issue additional equity or debt securities related to future acquisitions. 
 Substantial acquisitions or other transactions could require significant external capital and could change our risk and property profile. The expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to similar losses of institutional knowledge or disruptions. 
 Our assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena. 
 Our assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme temperatures. Insurance may be inadequate, and in some instances, it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.

 Royalty litigation 
 In October 2011, a potential class of royalty interest owners in New Mexico and Colorado filed a complaint against us in the County of Rio Arriba, New Mexico. The complaint presently alleges failure to pay royalty on hydrocarbons including drip condensate, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent concealment, conversion, misstatement of the value of gas and affiliated sales, breach of duty to market hydrocarbons in Colorado, breach of implied duty to market, violation of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Proceeds Payment Act, and bad faith breach of contract. Plaintiffs sought monetary damages and a declaratory judgment enjoining activities relating to production, payments and future reporting. However, the timing of any such guidance is uncertain and, independent of the issuance of additional guidance, ONRR asked producers to attempt to evaluate the deductibility of these fees directly with the midstream companies that transport and process gas.

"Station LLC is a gaming, development and management company established in 1976 that owns and operates six major gaming and entertainment facilities and nine smaller casinos (three of which are 50 owned) in the Las Vegas regional market. In February 2023 we opened our tenth smaller casino, Wildfire Fremont. As of December 31, 2022, we offered 13,921 slot machines, 233 table games and 2,821 hotel rooms in the Las Vegas market. 
 Inherent in the calculation of fair values are various estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or asset group. We base our cash flow estimates on the current regulatory, political and economic climates in the areas where we operate, recent operating information and projections for our properties. These estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal, state or local regulations, economic downturns, changes in consumer preferences, or events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties.","We expect to continue to evaluate expansion opportunities as they become available, and construct other new facilities or enhance our existing properties by constructing additional facilities in the future. Such construction projects entail significant risks, including the following, any of which can give rise to delays or cost overruns:

 unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems; 
 work stoppages; 
 weather interference; 
 floods; 
 unanticipated cost increases; and

 The anticipated costs and construction periods are based upon budgets, conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects and contractors. 
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including those relating to air emissions, water discharges and remediation of contamination. Such laws and regulations require us to obtain, maintain and renew environmental operating or construction permits or approvals, particularly in connection with our development activities. Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties, including past and present owners and operators of sites, related to the investigation or remediation of sites at which hazardous wastes or materials were disposed or released. Private parties may also bring claims arising from the presence of hazardous materials on a site or exposure to such materials. We are currently involved in monitoring activities at or adjacent to a few of our sites due to historical or nearby operations. Increasingly stringent environmental laws, regulations or standards may make compliance with such requirements more difficult or costly or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations, or any liabilities or claims arising under such laws or regulations, could require us to incur potentially significant costs or sanctions, including fines, penalties or cessation of operations, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The effects of climate change and/or increased regulation by international, national, state, regional, and local regulatory bodies of greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. 
 There has been an increasing focus of international, national, state, regional and local regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas GHG ), including carbon dioxide and methane, emissions, and climate change issues. The United States is a member of the Paris Agreement, a climate accord reached at the Conference of the Parties COP 21 in Paris, that set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. The Paris Agreement requires set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. Stronger GHG emission targets were set at COP 26 in Glasgow in November 2021 and affirmed at COP 27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in November 2022. 
 Future regulation could impose stringent standards to substantially reduce GHG emissions. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress. If such legislation is enacted, we could incur increased energy, environmental, and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the limitations. In addition, the current Administration has taken steps to further regulate GHG emissions. Due to uncertainty in the regulatory and legislative processes, as well as the scope of such requirements and initiatives, we cannot currently determine the effect such legislation and regulation may have on our operations, but it could be costly and difficult to implement. 
 Beyond financial and regulatory effects, the projected severe effects of climate change such as protracted drought and property damage or supply chain issues stemming from extreme weather events have the potential to directly affect our facilities and operations. We recognize the impacts of climate change and are engaged in several initiatives to identify, assess, and manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change (see Social Responsibility and Environmental Stewardship, above). 
 Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, consumers, employees, regulators, and others regarding our environmental, social and governance practices and reporting could cause us to incur additional costs, devote additional resources and expose us to additional risks, which could adversely impact our reputation, customer attraction and retention, access to capital and employee recruitment and retention. 
 Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance ESG practices and reporting. Investors, consumers, employees and other stakeholders have focused increasingly on ESG practices and placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments, purchases and other interactions with companies. With this increased focus, public reporting regarding ESG practices is becoming more broadly expected. If our ESG practices and reporting do not meet investor, consumer or employee expectations, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and customer retention may be negatively impacted. 
 Our ability to achieve any ESG objective is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: 
 the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources;

 the evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures; 
 the availability of suppliers that can meet sustainability, diversity and other ESG standards that we may set; 
 our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent in our labor markets; and 
 the success of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations. 
 If we fail, or are perceived to be failing, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure or the expectations of our various stakeholders, it could negatively impact our reputation, customer attraction and retention, access to capital and employee retention. In addition, new sustainability rules and regulations have been adopted and may continue to be introduced. Our failure to comply with any applicable rules or regulations could lead to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, customer attraction and retention, access to capital and employee retention.

In
the third quarter of 2007, we recognized a net repositioning charge of 26
million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 347
manufacturing and administrative positions associated with the rationalization
of manufacturing capacity and infrastructure, principally in our Automation and
Control Solutions, Transportation Systems and Aerospace segments. 

 In
the third quarter of 2006, we recognized a repositioning charge of 16 million
consisting of severance costs of 8 million related to workforce 

 39 

reductions of
124 manufacturing and administrative positions and 8 million for the
write-down of property, plant and equipment related to exiting a tolling
arrangement with a vendor. Cash expenditures for severance
and other costs necessary to execute the remaining actions will approximate
 100 million in 2007 and will be funded through operating cash flows. 

 In
the third quarter of 2007, we recognized a charge of 50 million for
environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable in the
quarter. We also recognized a charge of 28 million, net of probable insurance
recoveries, representing an update to our estimated liability for Bendix
related asbestos claims as of September 30, 2007. Asbestos matters are
discussed in detail in Note 15 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

 In
the third quarter of 2006, we recognized a charge of 58 million for
environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable in the
quarter. We recognized a charge of 33 million for Bendix related asbestos
claims filed and defense costs incurred during the third quarter of 2006, net
of probable insurance recoveries. We also recognized
other charges of 16 million in our Corporate segment primarily for a property
damage claim litigation matter in Brunswick, Ga., which was subsequently
settled. 

 In the first nine months of 2007, we
recognized a charge of 170 million for environmental liabilities deemed
probable and reasonably estimable in the period. We recognized a charge of 73
million, net of probable insurance recoveries, representing an update to our
estimated liability for Bendix related asbestos claims as of September 30,
2007. We also recognized other charges of 14 million for a business sale tax
related to a prior divestiture 8 million) and for a contemplated settlement
of a legal matter 6 million). 

 In
the first nine months of 2006, we recognized a charge of 168 million for
environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable in the
period. We recognized a charge of 110 million primarily for Bendix related
asbestos claims filed and defense costs incurred during the first nine months
of 2006, including an update of expected resolution values with respect to
claims pending as of June 30, 2006, net of probable insurance recoveries. OTHER
MATTERS 

 Litigation 

 We
are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which
involve substantial amounts) arising out of the conduct of our business. See a
discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters in Note 15
of Notes to Financial Statements. 

 Critical Accounting Policies 

 The
financial information as of September 30, 2007 should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 contained in
our Form 10-K filed on February 16, 2007.",,"['Again, this had an impact of about 20 basis points to our margin rate in the quarter.\nAcquisitions were also a headwind approximately 30 basis points primarily related to acquisition accounting and one time integration costs mostly associated with Norcross and Metrologic at ACS. By the way, just as a side note, weÃ¢ÂÂre very pleased with those acquisitions and Dave and I have had reviews with the operating teams recently and those transactions are coming out of the box very well in 2008.\nFinally, the hurricane impact, itÃ¢ÂÂs something thatÃ¢ÂÂs made a lot of headlines. We havenÃ¢ÂÂt really spoken about it but to just give you an update both Gustav and Ike had unfavorable impacts of our plant operations mostly within specialty materials as well as logistics in the gulf in the quarter.', 'The most significant impact was in Orange, Texas with the shut down of a specialty materials facility. We expect continued impact in that facility in the fourth quarter of Ã¢Â?8.\nWeÃ¢ÂÂre in the initial stages of assessing the overall impact for our potential insurance recoveries and weÃ¢ÂÂll be able to update you in the fourth quarter as we complete the year in terms of both the final impacts of those hurricanes as well as the potential recoveries.\nIn all 140 basis points of impact which translates to an adjusted margin rate of 13.9%. Obviously strong performance and weÃ¢ÂÂre very pleased about and compares by the way favorably with the third quarter of last year the reported 13.4% last year.\nLetÃ¢ÂÂs now go to the cash deployment slide.', 'Resins and chemicals were up 52% in the quarter driven by capro sales as well as the impact of higher raw material pricing, higher raw material costs and itÃ¢ÂÂs flow through as I mentioned earlier in terms of formula pricing. Fluorine products were up 18% primarily due to favorable pricing actions and higher volumes.\nAs we discussed earlier both formula pricing, the impact of the hurricanes were dilutive to the FM margins in the quarter and if we exclude these impacts margins would have been up more than 300 basis point. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs actually more like 200 basis points in the quarter, strong operational performance.\nWith that background having reviewed the four businesses letÃ¢ÂÂs take a look at the outlook for the remainder of the year, talk about the fourth quarter and the full year.']",negative,only_Mgm,treatment,10145,3.0,2.0,0.19999996,negative,0.604244053,2.0,7.0,1.0,433.0,0.0046189376443418,0.0161662817551963,0.0023094688221709
"Specialty Materials operating results, which generated 14 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007,
 are impacted by global economic growth rates, and capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining and petrochemical plants. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 15 percent of
 our consolidated revenues in 2007, are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions
 and fuel economy, and consumer spending levels and patterns for automotive aftermarket and car care products. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as further described
 below) and non-material inflation. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their
 non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes or governmental
 actions. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract
 penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. 
 We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If Honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing
 as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental or export laws), it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new
 government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire,
 security, safety, health care, enviornmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Specialty Materials results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of
 fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation
 Systems segment. 
 Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned.

We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. 
 We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to
 commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, import and export
 matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in
 litigation and other proceedings. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our
 results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. 
 Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. 
 Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to personal
 injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a
 party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving
 environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the
 environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly
 equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to
 comply with these laws and regulations. Specialty Materials operating results, which generated 14 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007,

 Economic and Other Factors 
 In addition to the factors listed below with respect to each of our operating segments, our consolidated operating results are principally driven by: 

Global economic growth rates (US, Europe and emerging regions); 

Overall sales mix, in particular the mix of Aerospace original equipment and aftermarket sales and the mix of Automation and Control Solutions products and services sales; 

The extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation; 

The impact of the pension discount rate on pension expense; and 

The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rate, particularly the US dollar-Euro exchange rate. 

Areas of Focus for 2008 
 The areas of focus for 2008, which are generally applicable to each of our operating segments, include: 

Driving profitable growth by building innovative products that address customer needs; 

Achieving sales growth, technological excellence and manufacturing capability through global expansion, especially focused on emerging regions in China, India and the Middle East; 

Continuing to grow through disciplined acquisition and rigorous integration processes; 

Proactively managing raw material cost increases with formula and long term fixed price agreements, price increases and hedging activities, where feasible; 

Driving free cash flow through increased net income and effective working capital management enabling continued investment in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, and enabling us to return
 value to shareholders through share repurchases and increased dividend payments; 

23 

Utilizing our enablers Honeywell Operating System (HOS), Functional Transformation and Velocity Product Development (VPD) to standardize the way we work, increase quality and reduce the
 costs of product manufacturing, reduce costs and enhance the quality of our administrative functions and improve business operations through investments in systems and process improvements; 

Managing Corporate costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement expenses and our tax expense; and 

Achieving productivity savings and price increases to offset inflation.

In 2007, we recognized repositioning charges totaling 209 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 3,408 manufacturing and administrative positions mainly in our
 Automation and Control Solutions and Aerospace segments. Also, 18 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Transportation Systems and Aerospace segments, were
 returned to income in 2007 due mainly to changes in the scope of previously announced severance programs and due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with prior
 severance programs. Cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the remaining actions will approximate 150
 million in 2008 and will be funded through operating cash flows. 
 In 2007, we recognized a charge of 225 million for environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable during the year. We recognized asbestos related litigation charges, net of
 insurance, of 100 million which are discussed in Note 21 to the financial statements. We also recognized impairment charges of 9 million related to the write-down of property, plant and equipment held for sale in our
 Specialty Materials segment. 
 In 2006, we recognized a charge of 210 million for environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable during the year. We recognized asbestos related litigation charges, net of
 insurance, of 126 million which are discussed in Note 21 to the financial statements. We recognized other charges of 51 million related to our Corporate segment primarily for the settlement of a property
 damage claim litigation matter in Brunswick, GA and our entrance into a plea agreement related to an environmental matter at our Baton Rouge, LA. facility. We also recognized a credit of 18 million in connection with an arbitration award for
 overcharges by a supplier of phenol to our Specialty Materials business for 2005 transactions. 
 In 2005, we recognized a charge of 186 million for environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable during the year. We recognized asbestos related litigation charges, net of
 insurance, of 10 million which are discussed in Note 21 to the financial statements. The sold receivables were 500 million at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. 
 In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends, employee benefit obligations,
 environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions, share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions. 
 Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2008 to be as follows: 

Capital expenditures we expect to spend approximately 900 million for capital expenditures in 2008 primarily for growth, replacement, production capacity expansion, cost reduction and
 maintenance. 

Repositioning actions we expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the remaining repositioning actions will approximate 150 million in 2008. 

Environmental remediation costs we expect to spend approximately 300 million in 2008 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs. See Environmental Matters in Note 21 to the financial
 statements for additional information. 

We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify
 business units that will most benefit from increased investment. Based on our current financial position and expected economic
 performance, we do not believe that our liquidity will be adversely impacted by an inability to access our sources of financing.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Following is a summary of our off-balance sheet arrangements: 
 Guarantees We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2007:

We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
 In connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the
 date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. 
 Retained Interests in Factored Pools of Trade Accounts Receivables As a source of liquidity, we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. Based on the underlying credit quality of
 the receivables placed into the designated pools of receivables being sold, we do not expect that any losses related to our retained interests at risk will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
 results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and
 procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in
 accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar
 businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past
 production of products containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. 
 With
 respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually
 conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible
 parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address
 environmental matters. It is our policy (see Note 1 to the financial statements)
 to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial
 efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably
 estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted
 future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities
 are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional 
 38 

technical or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and
 information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund
 expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. 
 Remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were 230, 210 and 186 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
 recorded liabilities for environmental matters was 799 and 831 million, respectively. In addition, in 2007 and 2006 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately 81 and 101
 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations. 
 Although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the
 timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods
 recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. 
 See Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation. 
 Financial Instruments 
 As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely
 affect our operating results and financial position. 
 Contingent Liabilities We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business
 operations or those of previously owned entities. These contingencies primarily relate to product liabilities (including asbestos), contractual matters, and environmental, health and safety matters. We
 recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well
 as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if
 applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of
 pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new
 developments (including new discovery of fact, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. For a
 discussion of our contingencies related to environmental, asbestos and other matters, including management s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, see Notes 1 and
 21 to the financial statements. 
 Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries We are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We maintain financial controls over the
 customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

OTHER MATTERS 
 Litigation 
 See Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements","Environment 
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the
 environment. It is our policy to comply with these requirements, and we believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
 environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with
 other companies engaged in similar businesses. 
 We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general
 matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of
 these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances
 in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these
 substances. 
 Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially
 responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection
 Agency s superfund priority list. Although, under some court interpretations of these laws, there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup
 costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. 
 Further information, including the current status of significant environmental matters and the financial impact incurred for remediation of such environmental matters, if any, is included in Item 7.
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and in
 Item 1A. Specialty Materials operating results, which generated 14 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007,
 are impacted by global economic growth rates, and capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining and petrochemical plants. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 15 percent of
 our consolidated revenues in 2007, are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions
 and fuel economy, and consumer spending levels and patterns for automotive aftermarket and car care products. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as further described
 below) and non-material inflation. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their
 non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes or governmental
 actions. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract
 penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. 
 We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If Honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing
 as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental or export laws), it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new
 government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire,
 security, safety, health care, enviornmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Specialty Materials results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of
 fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation
 Systems segment. 
 Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned. 
 13 

We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. 
 We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to
 commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, import and export
 matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in
 litigation and other proceedings. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our
 results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. 
 Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. 
 Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to personal
 injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a
 party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving
 environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the
 environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly
 equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to
 comply with these laws and regulations.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and in
 Item 1A. Specialty Materials operating results, which generated 14 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007,
 are impacted by global economic growth rates, and capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining and petrochemical plants. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 15 percent of
 our consolidated revenues in 2007, are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions
 and fuel economy, and consumer spending levels and patterns for automotive aftermarket and car care products. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as further described
 below) and non-material inflation. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their
 non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes or governmental
 actions. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract
 penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. 
 We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If Honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing
 as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental or export laws), it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new
 government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire,
 security, safety, health care, enviornmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Specialty Materials results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of
 fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation
 Systems segment. 
 Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned.

We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. 
 We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to
 commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, import and export
 matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in
 litigation and other proceedings. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our
 results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. 
 Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. 
 Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to personal
 injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a
 party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving
 environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the
 environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly
 equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to
 comply with these laws and regulations. 
 Environment 
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the
 environment. It is our policy to comply with these requirements, and we believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
 environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with
 other companies engaged in similar businesses. 
 We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general
 matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of
 these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances
 in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these
 substances. 
 Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially
 responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection
 Agency s superfund priority list. Although, under some court interpretations of these laws, there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup
 costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole.

By the way, just as a side note, weÃ¢ÂÂre very pleased with those acquisitions and Dave and I have had reviews with the operating teams recently and those transactions are coming out of the box very well in 2008.\nFinally, the hurricane impact, itÃ¢ÂÂs something thatÃ¢ÂÂs made a lot of headlines. We havenÃ¢ÂÂt really spoken about it but to just give you an update both Gustav and Ike had unfavorable impacts of our plant operations mostly within specialty materials as well as logistics in the gulf in the quarter.', 'The most significant impact was in Orange, Texas with the shut down of a specialty materials facility.

pricing reflecting the pass-through of higher raw material costs and other
pricing actions most significantly in Resins and Chemicals (including benefits
from formula based pricing arrangements) and Fluorine Products with sales
increase of 52 percent and 18 percent, respectively. These factors were
partially offset by i) a 14 percent decrease in UOP sales primarily as a result
of lower volume in its products business reflecting the anticipated decline in
the third quarter of 2008 in light of shipments that occurred previously in
2008, and ii) the unfavorable impact of hurricanes Gustav and Ike on plant
operations and logistics in the Gulf of Mexico region. This impact is expected
to continue in the fourth quarter of 2008, most significantly with the shutdown
of our Specialty Products Orange, Texas facility. We are in the initial stages
of assessing the overall impact of these hurricanes as well as our potential
insurance recoveries for both property damage and business interruption. We are
seeing preliminary signs of slowing global demand for commodities such as
caprolactam and ammonium sulfate and will continue to monitor these
developments. 

 Specialty
Materials segment profit increased by 1 percent in the third quarter of 2008

increased Resins and Chemicals and Fluorine Products sales as a result of the

substantially offset by lower UOP sales and the impacts of hurricanes Gustav
and Ike. Overall, the effects of increased pricing reflecting the pass-through
of higher raw material costs and other pricing actions (including benefits from
formula based pricing arrangements) and productivity gains substantially offset
raw material (most significantly sulfur) and other inflation.

 The fast-casual restaurant segment is highly competitive and can be materially adversely affected by many factors, including: 
 
 changes in local, regional or national economic conditions; 
 
 changes in demographic trends; 
 
 changes in consumer tastes; 
 
 changes in traffic patterns; 
 
 increases in fuel prices and utility costs; 
 
 consumer concerns about health, diet and nutrition; 
 
 increases in the number of, and particular locations of, competing restaurants; 
 
 changes in discretionary consumer spending; 
 
 inflation; 
 
 increases in the cost of commodities, such as beef, chicken and produce as well as the cost of paper goods and packaging; 
 
 increased labor costs, including unemployment insurance, minimum wage requirements, and increases in the cost of providing healthcare, including the impact of the Affordable Care Act; 
 
 costs related to remaining competitive and current with regard to new technologies in our restaurants such as on-line ordering and credit card security; 
 
 the availability of experienced management and hourly-paid employees; and

regional weather conditions. 
 Our continued growth depends on our ability to open and operate new restaurants profitably, which in turn depends on our continued access to capital, and newly developed restaurants may not perform as we expect and we cannot assure you that our growth and development plans will be achieved. 
 We may incur significant liability or reputational harm if claims are brought against us or against our franchisees. 
 We or our franchisees may be subject to complaints, regulatory proceedings or litigation from guests or other persons alleging food-related illness, injuries suffered on our premises or other food quality, health or operational concerns, including environmental claims. In addition, in recent years a number of restaurant companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging, among other things, violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage, rest break, meal break and overtime compensation issues and, in the case of quick-service restaurants, alleging that they have failed to disclose the health risks associated with high-fat or high sodium foods and that their marketing practices have encouraged obesity. However, we believe commodity price increases in 2015 will be mitigated through menu price increases and other initiatives, although there can be no assurance in such regard. The type, variety, quality and price of produce, beef, poultry, cheese and other commodities can be subject to change and to factors beyond our control, including weather, governmental regulation, availability and seasonality, each of which may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply. Our food distributors or suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, including higher minimum wage and benefit costs and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. 
 As of December 28, 2014 , excluding our franchised locations, all but seven of our Pollo Tropical restaurants were located in Florida and Texas and all but five of our Taco Cabana restaurants were located in Texas. Therefore, the economic conditions, state and local government regulations, weather conditions or other conditions affecting Florida and Texas, the tourism industry

 affecting Florida and other unforeseen events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts may have a material impact on the success of our restaurants in those locations. 
 Many of our restaurants are located in regions that may be susceptible to severe weather conditions. As a result, adverse weather conditions in any of these areas could damage these restaurants, result in fewer guest visits to these restaurants and otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business. For example, our Florida and certain of our Texas restaurants are susceptible to hurricanes and other severe tropical weather events, and in the past, a number of our Taco Cabana restaurants have been periodically affected by severe winter weather. 
 Economic downturns may adversely impact consumer spending patterns. If we were to incur a significant number of sale to minor violations the fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Federal, state and local environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials could expose us to liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous substances or other regulated materials, release of pollutants into the air, soil and water, and the remediation of contaminated sites. 
 Failure to comply with environmental laws could result in the imposition of fines or penalties, restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts of law, as well as investigatory or remedial liabilities and claims for alleged personal injury or damages to property or natural resources. Some environmental laws impose strict, and under some circumstances joint and several, liability for costs of investigation and remediation of contaminated sites on current and prior owners or operators of the sites, as well as those entities that send regulated materials to the sites. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. Therefore, our costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing property subject to long-term non-cancelable leases.","[""But when we talk 3 months from now and we will be talking about weather in October, I know people will have a hard time to remember exactly what we're talking about.

 Other long-term obligations include estimated environmental payments. We estimate, based on historical experience that we will spend between 1 and 3 per year on environmental
investigation and remediation. We are contractually required to spend a portion of these obligations based on existing agreements with various governmental agencies and other entities. At December 31, 2011, we estimated total environmental
liabilities of 29. The table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements and expected voluntary contributions for defined
benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.","Misconduct, fraud or other improper
activities by our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal, state or local government procurement
regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, laws and regulations relating to environmental matters, bribery of foreign government
officials, import-export control, lobbying or similar activities, and any other applicable laws or regulations. Misconduct involving data security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use of our customer s
sensitive or classified information could result in remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability or reduced
productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the timelines and availability of materials, major subcontractor performance and quality of their products, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and
timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our combined
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In some instances, we have licensed the proprietary intellectual property of others, but we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable
terms. Unforeseen environmental issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
 Our operations are subject to and affected by many federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. In addition, we could
be affected by future environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, those imposed in response to climate change concerns. Compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to
continue to require significant operating and capital costs. Environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions
as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. We also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with
current environmental laws and regulations related to

maintained by the General Services Administration, we could become ineligible to receive certain contracts, subcontracts and other benefits from the federal government or to perform work under a government contract or subcontract at any listed
facility. Generally, such ineligibility would continue until the basis for the listing has been appropriately addressed. Developments such as the
adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, violations by us of such laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving
environmental impacts, our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments under previously priced contracts, or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial

 In connection with our separation, ITT and Xylem Inc. We cannot predict the prices at which our

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business; 

success or failure of our business strategy; 

our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry; 

our ability to obtain financing as needed; 

announcements by us or our competitors of significant new business awards; 

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; 

changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; 

changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;

2014 FIFA World Cup and Recent Events in Brazil 
 The 2014 World Cup (the World Cup or 2014 World Cup took place in Brazil from June 12 to July 13, 2014. New restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher food, labor and other direct operating expenses and, as a result, restaurant contribution margins are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities. 
 Comparable Restaurant Sales 
 We consider a restaurant to be comparable during the first full fiscal quarter following the eighteenth full month of operations. We test our goodwill annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, or more frequently should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof. We have identified two reporting units, the US and Brazil, based on the geography of the Company s operations to which goodwill is attributable.","In addition, we plan to grow in Brazil as well as other international markets, however there is no guarantee that we will be able to increase the number of our restaurants in North America or in international markets. Our ability to successfully open new restaurants is, in turn, dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 

finding and securing quality locations on acceptable financial terms; 

complying with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations; 

obtaining, for an acceptable cost, required permits and approvals; 

having adequate financing for construction, opening and operating costs; 

controlling construction and equipment costs for new restaurants; 

weather, natural disasters and disasters beyond our control resulting in delays; 

hiring, training and retaining management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs; and 

successfully promoting new restaurants and competing in the markets in which these are located. 

 We continuously review potential sites for future restaurants. Any failure on our part to recognize or respond to these challenges may adversely affect the success of any new restaurants. 
 
 18 

The number and timing of new restaurants opened during any given period, and their associated contribution to operating growth, may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, without limitation: 

identification and availability of appropriate locations that will increase the number of restaurant guests and sales per unit; 

inability to generate sufficient funds from operations or to obtain acceptable financing to support our development; 

recruitment and training of qualified operating personnel in the local market; 

availability of acceptable lease arrangements; 

construction and development cost management; 

timely delivery of the leased premises to us from our landlords and punctual commencement of our buildout construction activities; 

delays due to the customized nature of our restaurant concepts and decor, construction and pre-opening processes for each new location; 

obtaining all necessary governmental licenses and permits, including our liquor licenses, on a timely basis to construct or remodel and operate our restaurants; 

inability to comply with certain covenants under our 2015 Credit Facility that could limit our ability to open new restaurants; 

consumer tastes in new geographic regions and acceptance of our restaurant concept; 

competition in new markets, including competition for restaurant sites; unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with the leased premises; 

adverse weather during the construction period; anticipated commercial, residential and infrastructure development near our new restaurants; and 

other unanticipated increases in costs, any of which could give rise to delays or cost overruns. 

 If we are unable to successfully open new restaurants, our financial results or revenue growth could be adversely affected and our business negatively affected as we expect a portion of our growth to come from new restaurants.

Increases in the prices of, or reductions in the availability of, top-quality beef could reduce our operating margins and revenue. 
 We purchase substantial quantities of beef, particularly Angus Beef (and its equivalent in Brazil), which is subject to significant price fluctuations due to conditions affecting livestock markets, weather, feed prices, industry demand and other factors. Our meat costs accounted for approximately 56.9 of our total food and beverage costs in the US during Fiscal 2014 and approximately 57.4 during Fiscal 2015. 
 If we pay higher prices for food items or other supplies or increase compensation or benefits to our employees, we will sustain an increase in our operating costs. Many factors affect the prices paid for food and other items, including conditions affecting livestock markets, weather, changes in demand and inflation. Factors that may affect compensation and benefits paid to our employees include changes in minimum wage and employee benefits laws (as discussed below). We do not know when the District Court will rule on our complaint. 
 Due to the current climate and uncertainty relative to the process of requesting and obtaining L-1B visas, as well as recent denials of certain requests, we will continue to explore all available legal means to bring employees from Brazil to work in our restaurants in the US. Continued compliance with existing US or foreign immigration laws or changes in such laws, making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to retain visas or work permits for current employees in the US, could materially adversely affect our expansion strategy and, more generally, our business and financial performance. Losses for such uninsured claims, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Compliance with environmental laws may negatively affect our business. 
 We are subject to national, provincial, state and local laws and regulations in the US, Brazil and Mexico concerning waste disposal, pollution, protection of the environment, and the presence, discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance and liabilities for remediation, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such hazardous or toxic substances at, on or from our restaurants. Environmental conditions relating to releases of hazardous substances at prior, existing or future restaurant sites could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, environmental laws, and the administration, interpretation and enforcement thereof, are subject to change and may become more stringent in the future, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.","[""And obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty out there from a political perspective.

"Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our outstanding indebtedness and the amortization of our debt issuance costs reduced by capitalized interest. 
 Results of Operations 
 Potential Fluctuations in Quarterly Results and Seasonality 
 Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses, profitability of new restaurants, weather, increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales, general economic conditions, consumer confidence in the economy, changes in consumer preferences, competitive factors, changes in food costs, changes in labor costs and rising gas prices. In the past, we have experienced significant variability in restaurant pre-opening costs from quarter to quarter primarily due to the timing of restaurant openings. Accordingly, the number and timing of new restaurant openings in any quarter has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on quarterly restaurant pre-opening costs, labor and direct operating costs. 
 Our business also is subject to fluctuations due to seasonality and adverse weather. The spring and summer months have traditionally had higher sales volume than other periods of the year. Holidays, severe winter weather, hurricanes, thunderstorms and similar conditions may impact restaurant unit volumes in some of the markets where we operate and may have a greater impact should they occur during our higher volume months. As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
 the success of our existing and new restaurants; 
 
 our ability to identify appropriate sites and develop and expand our operations; 
 
 changes in economic conditions; 
 
 changes in food availability and costs, including a continuation of recent trends of increased food costs; 
 
 damage to our reputation or lack of acceptance of our brand in existing or new markets; 
 
 economic and other trends and developments, including adverse weather conditions, in the local or regional areas in which our restaurants are located; 
 
 the impact of negative economic factors, including the availability of credit, on our landlords and surrounding tenants; 
 
 labor shortages and increases in our labor costs, including as a result of changes in government regulation such as the adoption of the new federal healthcare legislation; 
 
 increased competition in the restaurant industry and the segments in which we compete; 
 
 the impact of legislation and regulations regarding nutritional information, and new information or attitudes regarding diet and health or adverse opinions about the health of consuming our menu offerings; 
 
 the impact of federal, state and local beer, liquor and food service regulations; 
 
 the impact of litigation; 
 
 the success of our marketing programs; 
 
 the impact of new restaurant openings, including on the effect on our existing restaurants of opening new restaurants in the same markets; 
 
 the loss of key members of our management team and the transition to new officers; 
 
 strain on our infrastructure and resources caused by our growth; 
 
 the inadequacy of our insurance coverage and fluctuating insurance requirements and costs; 
 
 the impact of our indebtedness on our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business; 
 
 our ability to obtain debt or other financing on favorable terms or at all; 
 
 the impact of a potential requirement to record asset impairment charges in the future; 
 
 the impact of security breaches of confidential customer information in connection with our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions; 
 
 inadequate protection of our intellectual property; 
 
 the failure of our information technology system or the breach of our network security; 
 
 a major natural or man-made disaster; 
 
 the impact of our election to take advantage of certain exemptions applicable to emerging growth companies; 
 
 the failure of our internal control over financial reporting; 
 
 the impact of federal, state and local tax rules; 
 
 volatility in the price of our common stock; 
 
 the impact of future sales of our common stock in the public market, and the exercise of stock options and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of our common stock; 
 
 the impact of a downgrade of our shares by securities analysts or industry analysts, the publication of negative research or reports, or lack of publication of reports about our business;

In addition, 2013 results were negatively impacted by an ice storm in early December, which had an approximate 500,000 negative impact on revenue. 
 Due to the inclusion of a 53rd week in fiscal 2012, there is a one-week calendar shift in the comparison of the comparable sales for 52-week period ended December 29, 2013, to the 52-week period ended December 30, 2012. In determining the recoverability of the asset value, an analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level and primarily includes an assessment of historical cash flows and other relevant factors and circumstances. The other factors and circumstances include changes in the economic environment, changes in the manner in which assets are used, unfavorable changes in legal factors or business climate, incurring excess costs in construction of the asset, overall restaurant operating performance and projections for future performance. These estimates result in a wide range of variability on a year to year basis due to the nature of the criteria.","We may not be able to open our planned new restaurants on a timely basis, if at all, and, if opened, these restaurants may not be operated profitably. The number and timing of new restaurants opened during any given period, and their associated contribution to operating growth, may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, without limitation: 
 
 identification and availability of appropriate locations that will drive high levels of customer traffic and sales per unit; 
 
 inability to generate sufficient funds from operations or to obtain acceptable financing to support our development; 
 
 recruitment and training of qualified operating personnel in the local market; 
 
 availability of acceptable lease arrangements, including sufficient levels of tenant allowances; 
 
 the financial viability of our landlords, including the availability of financing for our landlords and our landlords ability to pay tenant incentives on a timely basis; 
 
 construction and development cost management; 
 
 timely delivery of the leased premises to us from our landlords and punctual commencement of our buildout construction activities; 
 
 delays due to the customized nature of our restaurant concepts and decor, construction and pre-opening processes for each new location; 
 
 obtaining all necessary governmental licenses and permits, including our liquor licenses, on a timely basis to construct or remodel and operate our restaurants; 
 
 inability to comply with certain covenants under our revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Credit Facility"") that could limit our ability to open new restaurants; 
 
 consumer tastes in new geographic regions and acceptance of our restaurant concept; 
 
 competition in new markets, including competition for restaurant sites; 
 
 unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with the leased premises; 
 
 adverse weather during the construction period; 
 
 anticipated commercial, residential and infrastructure development near our new restaurants; and 
 
 other unanticipated increases in costs, any of which could give rise to delays or cost overruns. 
 We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, delays in restaurant openings from time to time. As a result, our brand value may be adversely affected by any negative publicity related to Baja Chuy s or any other restaurant that may use brand names, trademarks or trade dress that are similar to ours. 
 We are susceptible to economic and other trends and developments, including adverse weather conditions, in the local or regional areas in which our restaurants are located. 
 Our financial performance is highly dependent on restaurants located in Texas and the Southeastern and Midwestern United States. In recent years, certain of these states have been more negatively impacted by the housing decline, high unemployment rates and the overall economic crisis than other geographic areas. In addition, given our geographic concentrations, particularly in Texas, negative publicity regarding any of our restaurants in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, as could other regional occurrences such as local strikes, terrorist attacks, increases in energy prices, adverse weather conditions, hurricanes, droughts or other natural or man-made disasters. Adverse weather conditions may also impact customer traffic at our restaurants, cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating, and, in more severe cases, cause temporary restaurant closures, sometimes for prolonged periods. 
 Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with restaurant sales typically higher during the spring and summer months as well as in December. Adverse weather conditions during our most favorable months or periods may exacerbate the effect of adverse weather on customer traffic and may cause fluctuations in our operating results from quarter-to-quarter within a fiscal year. In addition, outdoor patio seating is available at nearly all of our restaurants and may be impacted by a number of weather-related 
 15

 factors. Our inability to fully utilize our restaurants seating capacity as planned may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. Changes in the price, as a result of inflation or otherwise, or availability of certain food products could affect the profitability of certain food items, our ability to maintain existing prices and our ability to purchase sufficient amounts of items to satisfy our customer s demands, which could materially adversely affect our profitability and reputation. 
 The type, variety, quality, availability and price of produce, beef, chicken and cheese are more volatile than other types of food and are subject to factors beyond our control, including weather, governmental regulation, availability and seasonality, each of which may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply. Our food distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higher minimum wage and benefit costs and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. The honeymoon period refers to the weeks following a restaurant's initial opening, during which sales are typically higher than normal. In addition, 2013 results were negatively impacted by an ice storm in early December, which had an approximate 500,000 negative impact on revenue.

 Results of Operations 
 Potential Fluctuations in Quarterly Results and Seasonality 
 Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses, profitability of new restaurants, weather, increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales, general economic conditions, consumer confidence in the economy, changes in consumer preferences, competitive factors, changes in food costs, changes in labor costs and rising gas prices. In the past, we have experienced significant variability in restaurant pre-opening costs from quarter to quarter primarily due to the timing of restaurant openings. Accordingly, the number and timing of new restaurant openings in any quarter has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on quarterly restaurant pre-opening costs, labor and direct operating costs. 
 Our business also is subject to fluctuations due to seasonality and adverse weather. The spring and summer months have traditionally had higher sales volume than other periods of the year. Holidays, severe winter weather, hurricanes, thunderstorms and similar conditions may impact restaurant unit volumes in some of the markets where we operate and may have a greater impact should they occur during our higher volume months. As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. The increase in comparable restaurant sales was driven primarily by a 3.3 increase in average check, offset by a 1.4 decrease in average weekly customers. The decrease in average weekly customers is attributable to higher than normal inclement weather days throughout the Southeast and Texas which had an approximate 1.1 million impact on comparable sales. Our revenue mix attributed to bar sales was 18.0 during the thirteen weeks ended March 29, 2015 compared to 18.4 during the comparable period in 2014 . Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
 the success of our existing and new restaurants; 
 
 our ability to identify appropriate sites and develop and expand our operations; 
 
 changes in economic conditions; 
 
 damage to our reputation or lack of acceptance of our brand in existing or new markets;

,"There are a myriad of potential events
that could disrupt our foreign supply chain, including the following: 

bankruptcy of sourcing partners or limits on their ability to obtain credit to finance production; 
 political instability, acts of war or terrorism, or other international events resulting in the disruption of trade with
countries where our sourcing partners' manufacturing facilities are located; 
 a government or government agency may condemn and convert for public use (i.e. through eminent domain) all or a
part of the property owned by one or more of our suppliers, as recently happened to one of our suppliers in China; 
 disruptions in shipping and freight forwarding services, including dockworker or port strikes; 
 increases in oil prices, which would increase the cost of shipping, and raw materials and wages, which would increase our
cost of sales; 
 interruptions in the availability of basic services and infrastructure, including power outages; 
 extraordinary weather conditions (such as hurricanes) or natural disasters (such as earthquakes or tsunamis); 
 the occurrence of an epidemic, the spread of which may impede our ability to obtain products on a timely basis; 
 in the event of safeguard embargoes, many of the Chinese factories may lose workers which would likely affect their
ability to service the business when the embargoes are lifted; or 
 as our suppliers open new plants in new countries, costs of labor may be higher and worker productivity may be lower than
at existing plants. 

These
and other events could interrupt production in offshore facilities, increase our cost of sales, disrupt merchandise deliveries, delay receipt of the products into the United States or elsewhere
or prevent us from sourcing our products at all. There
can be no assurance that prices for these and other raw materials will not increase in the near future. These raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, power
outages, government regulations, economic climate and other unpredictable factors. Fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may also influence the prices of related items such as chemicals,
dyestuffs, man-made fiber and foam. 

 Our company-operated outlet stores are located principally in outlet centers, which are typically located at or near vacation destinations or away from large population centers
where department stores and other traditional retailers are concentrated. As a result, developments that would lead to decreased travel, such as fuel shortages, increased fuel prices, travel
restrictions, travel concerns, bad weather and
other circumstances, including as a result of war, terrorist attacks or the perceived threat of war or terrorist attacks, could have a material adverse effect on us. Other factors which could affect
the success of our stores include: 

the location of the outlet center or the location of a particular store within an outlet center; 
 
 2011 Form

Table of Contents 

the other tenants occupying space at the outlet center; 
 increased competition in areas where outlet centers are located; 
 the opening of outlet centers closer to population centers, which could materially decrease the traffic to existing outlet
centers that are located further away from established population centers; 
 a downturn in the economy generally or in a particular area where an outlet center is located;
and 
 the amount of advertising and promotional dollars spent by the landlord of the outlet center to attract consumers to the
outlet center. 

 Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to further improve sales, as well as both gross margins and operating margins, at our company-operated
outlet stores. A variety of factors affect comparable store sales, including competition, current economic conditions, the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our
merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. 

 We rely on our information technology systems to manage internal operations and financial reporting and, through our e-commerce websites, to generate sales of our
products. Our computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage, cyber attacks, interruption or failure as a result of, among other things, power or telecommunications
failures, hardware failures or software errors; human error; computer viruses, acts of vandalism or sabotage (and resulting potential lapses in security), both internal and external; natural
disasters, fires, floods or other acts of God; acts of war or terrorism or other armed hostility; and loss of support services from third parties, including those to whom we outsource aspects of our

receipt of regulatory approvals and compliance with contractual obligations required in connection with the planned MLP; 
 
 the impact of the planned MLP on our relationships with our employees, customers and vendors and our credit rating and cost of funds; and 
 
 the possibility that the interests of our financial sponsors (funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. and First Reserve Management, L.P.) will conflict with ours. Risk Factors 
 The following Risk Factor disclosure updates the risk factors as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 previously filed with the SEC. 
 
 We could incur substantial costs or disruptions in our business if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations or otherwise comply with health, safety, environmental and other laws and regulations. 
 Our operations require numerous permits and authorizations under various laws and regulations. Any or all of these matters could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may incur significant liability under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, environmental and health and safety regulations, which are complex and change frequently. 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. 
 We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. 
 Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several, liability for costs of investigation and cleanup of such spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at, contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages 
 54 

allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future releases or spills, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean-up obligations, the liability to third parties for damage to their property, or the need to address newly-discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Furthermore, our Delaware City refinery and our Delaware City Rail Terminal are located in Delaware's coastal zone where certain activities are regulated under the Delaware Coastal Zone Act and closely monitored by environmental interest groups. On June 14, 2013, two administrative appeals were filed by the Sierra Club and Delaware Audubon regarding an air permit Delaware City Refining Company LLC obtained to allow loading of crude oil onto barges. 
 API means the American Petroleum Institute.

 The following Risk Factor disclosure updates the risk factors as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 previously filed with the SEC. 
 We could incur substantial costs or disruptions in our business if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations or otherwise comply with health, safety, environmental and other laws and regulations. 
 Our operations require numerous permits and authorizations under various laws and regulations. Any or all of these matters could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may incur significant liability under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, environmental and health and safety regulations, which are complex and change frequently. 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. 
 We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. 
 Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several, liability for costs of investigation and cleanup of such spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at, contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future releases or spills, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean-up obligations, the liability to third parties for 
 56 

damage to their property, or the need to address newly-discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Furthermore, our Delaware City refinery and our Delaware City Rail Terminal are located in Delaware's coastal zone where certain activities are regulated under the Delaware Coastal Zone Act and closely monitored by environmental interest groups. On June 14, 2013, two administrative appeals were filed by the Sierra Club and Delaware Audubon regarding an air permit Delaware City Refining obtained to allow loading of crude oil onto barges. No schedule has yet been set for the appeals in Superior Court. A hearing on the second appeal before the Environmental Appeals Board, case no. 2013-06, has been scheduled for January 21, 2014, with a motions to dismiss scheduled to be heard on December 10, 2013. 
 We may have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate. 
 If we cannot generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short-term and long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations or our future debt obligations, comply with certain deadlines related to environmental regulations and standards, or pursue our business strategies, including acquisitions, in which case our operations may not perform as we currently expect. We have substantial short-term capital needs and may have substantial long term capital needs. 
 In addition, from time to time, we are required to spend significant amounts for repairs when one or more processing units experiences temporary shutdowns. We continue to utilize significant capital to upgrade equipment, improve facilities, and reduce operational, safety and environmental risks. In connection with the Paulsboro acquisition, we assumed certain significant environmental obligations, and may similarly do so in future acquisitions. We will likely incur substantial compliance costs in connection with new or changing environmental, health and safety regulations. See Item 2.","[""And I see a crack market here that I think is going to stay robust. And of course, there'll be up and downs, there'll be seasonal changes, there'll be things -- we didn't have a hurricane last year on the Gulf Coast, very unusual environment.

"As a result, we are more susceptible to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors and any unforeseen events or circumstances that affect the area could also materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability. These factors include, among other things, changes in the economy, damages to infrastructure, weather conditions, demographics and population. 
 23 

We must make substantial capital expenditures on our operating facilities to maintain their reliability and efficiency. 
 Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of new facilities (or improvements and repairs to our existing facilities and equipment) could adversely affect our ability to achieve targeted internal rates of return and operating results. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors in the marketplace, many of which are beyond our control, including: 
 
 denial or delay in issuing regulatory approvals and/or permits; 
 
 unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; 
 
 disruptions in transportation of modular components and/or construction materials; 
 
 severe adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors and suppliers; 
 
 shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; 
 
 market-related increases in a project s debt or equity financing costs; and/or 
 
 non-performance or force majeure by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or sub-contractors involved with a project. 
 Our refineries contain many processing units, a number of which have been in operation for many years. Our ability to do so will be dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms, successfully integrate acquired assets and obtain financing to fund acquisitions and to support our growth and many other factors beyond our control. Risks associated with acquisitions include those relating to the diversion of management time and attention from our existing business, liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities and greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental, safety or other regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures relating to acquired assets. We may also enter into transition services agreements in the future with sellers of any additional refineries we acquire. Moreover, such transactions may limit our ability to benefit from favorable changes in crude oil and refined product prices. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: 
 
 the volumes of our actual use of crude oil or production of the applicable refined products is less than the volumes subject to the hedging arrangement; 
 
 accidents, interruptions in feedstock transportation, inclement weather or other events cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refineries, or those of our suppliers or customers; 
 
 changes in commodity prices have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our hedging arrangements, resulting in our being subject to margin calls; 
 
 the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or 
 
 a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts the commodity or crack spread subject to the hedging arrangement. 
 As a result, the effectiveness of our hedging strategy could have a material impact on our financial results. If a key system was hacked or otherwise interfered with by an unauthorized access, or was to fail or experience unscheduled downtime for any reason, even if only for a short period, our operations and financial results could be affected adversely. Our systems could be damaged or interrupted by a security breach, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure or similar event. We have a formal disaster recovery plan in place, but this plan may not prevent delays or other complications that could arise from an information systems failure. Product liability claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. 
 We may incur significant liability under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, environmental and health and safety regulations, which are complex and change frequently. 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. 
 We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. 
 Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several, liability for costs of investigation and cleanup of such spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at, contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future releases or spills, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean-up obligations, the liability to third parties for damage to their property, or the need to address newly-discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Furthermore, our Delaware City refinery and our Delaware City Rail Terminal are located in Delaware's coastal zone where certain activities are regulated under the Delaware Coastal Zone Act and closely monitored by environmental interest groups. On June 14, 2013, two administrative appeals were filed by the Sierra Club and Delaware Audubon regarding a permit Delaware City Refining Company LLC DCR obtained to allow loading of crude oil onto barges. The appeals allege that both the loading of crude oil onto barges and the operation of the Delaware City rail unloading terminal violate Delaware s Coastal Zone Act. The first appeal is Number 2013-1 before the State Coastal Zone Industrial Control Board (the CZ Board ), and the second appeal is before the Environmental Appeals Board and appeals Secretary s Order No. 2013-A-0020. Briefs are due to be filed in this appeal in the first quarter of 2014 but no date has been set for a decision by the Superior Court. A hearing on the second appeal before the Environmental Appeals Board, case no. 2013-06, was held on January 13, 2014, and the Board ruled in favor of Delaware City Refining and the State and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. If the Appellants in one or both of these matters ultimately prevail, the outcome may have an adverse material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Environmental clean-up and remediation costs of our sites and environmental litigation could decrease our net cash flow, reduce our results of operations and impair our financial condition. 
 We are subject to liability for the investigation and clean-up of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own or operate and at off-site locations where we arrange for the treatment or disposal of regulated materials. We may become involved in future litigation or other proceedings. Currently remediation projects are underway in accordance with regulatory requirements at the Paulsboro and Delaware City refineries. In connection with the acquisitions of our refineries, the prior owners have retained certain liabilities or indemnified us for certain liabilities, including those relating to pre-acquisition soil and groundwater conditions, and in some instances we have assumed certain liabilities and environmental obligations, including certain remediation obligations at the Paulsboro refinery. If the prior owners fail to satisfy their obligations for any reason, or if significant liabilities arise in the areas in which we assumed liability, we may become responsible for remediation expenses and other environmental liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. As a result, in addition to making capital expenditures or incurring other costs to comply with environmental laws, we also may be liable for significant environmental litigation or for investigation and remediation costs and other liabilities arising from the ownership or operation of these assets by prior owners, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations and Commitments and Item 1. Business Environmental, Health and Safety Matters. 
 We may also face liability arising from current or future claims alleging personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other regulated materials, such as asbestos, benzene, MTBE and petroleum hydrocarbons, at or from our facilities. We may also face liability for personal injury, property damage, natural resource damage or clean-up costs for the alleged migration of contamination from our properties. A significant increase in the number or success of these claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 
 Regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases could force us to incur increased capital and operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, including proposals to: (i) establish a cap and trade system, (ii) create a federal renewable energy or clean energy standard requiring electric utilities to provide a certain percentage of power from such sources, and (iii) create enhanced incentives for use of renewable energy and increased efficiency in energy supply and use. In addition, the EPA is taking steps to regulate GHGs under the existing federal Clean Air Act, or CAA. The EPA has already adopted regulations limiting emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles, addressing the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources, and requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources, including refineries. These and similar regulations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report GHG emissions or reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. In addition, various states, individually as well as in some cases on a regional basis, have taken steps to control GHG emissions, including adoption of GHG reporting requirements, cap and trade systems and renewable portfolio standards. Efforts have also been undertaken to delay, limit or prohibit EPA and possibly state action to regulate GHG emissions, and it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate form, timing or extent of federal or state regulation. In the event we do incur increased costs as a result of increased efforts to control GHG emissions, we may not be able to pass on any of these costs to our customers. Such requirements also could adversely affect demand for the refined petroleum products that we produce. If changes in law, regulations or industry standards occur that result in requirements to reduce the volatile or flammable constituents in crude oil that is transported by rail, alter the design or standards for rail cars, change the routing or scheduling of trains carrying crude oil, or any other changes that detrimentally affect the economics of delivering North American crude oil by rail to our refineries, our costs could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We could incur substantial costs or disruptions in our business if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations or otherwise comply with health, safety, environmental and other laws and regulations. 
 Our operations require numerous permits and authorizations under various laws and regulations. Any or all of these matters could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may incur significant liability under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, environmental and health and safety regulations, which are complex and change frequently. 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. 
 We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. 
 Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several liability for, costs of investigation and cleanup of such spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future releases or spills, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean-up obligations, the liability to third parties for damage to their property, or the need to address newly-discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Furthermore, our Delaware City refinery and our Delaware City Rail Terminal are located in Delaware's coastal zone where certain activities are regulated under the Delaware Coastal Zone Act and closely monitored by environmental interest groups. On June 14, 2013, two administrative appeals were filed by the Sierra Club and Delaware Audubon regarding a permit Delaware City Refining Company LLC DCR obtained to allow loading of crude oil onto barges. The appeals allege that both the loading of crude oil onto barges and the operation of the Delaware City rail unloading terminal violate Delaware s Coastal Zone Act. The first appeal is Number 2013-1 before the State Coastal Zone Industrial Control Board (the CZ Board ), and the second appeal is before the Environmental Appeals Board and appeals Secretary s Order No. 2013-A-0020. Briefs are due to be filed in this appeal in the first quarter of 2014 but no date has been set for a decision by the Superior Court. A hearing on the second appeal before the Environmental Appeals Board, case no. 2013-06, was held on January 13, 2014, and the Board ruled in favor of Delaware City Refining and the State and

dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. If a key system was hacked or otherwise interfered with by an unauthorized access, or was to fail or experience unscheduled downtime for any reason, even if only for a short period, our operations and financial results could be affected adversely. Our systems could be damaged or interrupted by a security breach, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure or similar event. We have a formal disaster recovery plan in place, but this plan may not prevent delays or other complications that could arise from an information systems failure. Product liability claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. 
 We may incur significant liability under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, environmental and health and safety regulations, which are complex and change frequently. 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. 
 We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. 
 Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several, liability for costs of investigation and cleanup of such spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at, contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future releases or spills, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean-up obligations, the liability to third parties for damage to their property, or the need to address newly-discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Furthermore, our Delaware City refinery and our Delaware City Rail Terminal are located in Delaware's coastal zone where certain activities are regulated under the Delaware Coastal Zone Act and closely monitored by environmental interest groups. On June 14, 2013, two administrative appeals were filed by the Sierra Club and Delaware Audubon regarding a permit Delaware City Refining Company LLC DCR obtained to allow loading of crude oil onto barges. The appeals allege that both the loading of crude oil onto barges and the operation of the Delaware City rail unloading terminal violate Delaware s Coastal Zone Act. The first appeal is Number 2013-1 before the State Coastal Zone Industrial Control Board (the CZ Board ), and the second appeal is before the Environmental Appeals Board and appeals Secretary s Order No. 2013-A-0020. Briefs are due to be filed in this appeal in the first quarter of 2014 but no date has been set for a decision by the Superior Court. A hearing on the second appeal before the Environmental Appeals Board, case no. 2013-06, was held on January 13, 2014, and the Board ruled in favor of Delaware City Refining and the State and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. If the Appellants in one or both of these matters ultimately prevail, the outcome may have an adverse material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Environmental clean-up and remediation costs of our sites and environmental litigation could decrease our net cash flow, reduce our results of operations and impair our financial condition. 
 We are subject to liability for the investigation and clean-up of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own or operate and at off-site locations where we arrange for the treatment or disposal of regulated materials. We may become involved in future litigation or other proceedings. Currently remediation projects are underway in accordance with regulatory requirements at the Paulsboro and Delaware City refineries. In connection with the acquisitions of our refineries, the prior owners have retained certain liabilities or indemnified us for certain liabilities, including those relating to pre-acquisition soil and groundwater conditions, and in some instances we have assumed certain liabilities and environmental obligations, including certain remediation obligations at the Paulsboro refinery. If the prior owners fail to satisfy their obligations for any reason, or if significant liabilities arise in the areas in which we assumed liability, we may become responsible for remediation expenses and other environmental liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. As a result, in addition to making capital expenditures or incurring other costs to comply with environmental laws, we also may be liable for significant environmental litigation or for investigation and remediation costs and other liabilities arising from the ownership or operation of these assets by prior owners, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations and Commitments and Item 1. Business Environmental, Health and Safety Matters. 
 We may also face liability arising from current or future claims alleging personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other regulated materials, such as asbestos, benzene, MTBE and petroleum hydrocarbons, at or from our facilities. We may also face liability for personal injury, property damage, natural resource damage or clean-up costs for the alleged migration of contamination from our properties. A significant increase in the number or success of these claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 
 Regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases could force us to incur increased capital and operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, including proposals to: (i) establish a cap and trade system, (ii) create a federal renewable energy or clean energy standard requiring electric utilities to provide a certain percentage of power from such sources, and (iii) create enhanced incentives for use of renewable energy and increased efficiency in energy supply and use. In addition, the EPA is taking steps to regulate GHGs under the existing federal Clean Air Act, or CAA. The EPA has already adopted regulations limiting emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles, addressing the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources, and requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources, including refineries. These and similar regulations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report GHG emissions or reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. In addition, various states, individually as well as in some cases on a regional basis, have taken steps to control GHG emissions, including adoption of GHG reporting requirements, cap and trade systems and renewable portfolio standards. Efforts have also been undertaken to delay, limit or prohibit EPA and possibly state action to regulate GHG emissions, and it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate form, timing or extent of federal or state regulation. In the event we do incur increased costs as a result of increased efforts to control GHG emissions, we may not be able to pass on any of these costs to our customers. Such requirements also could adversely affect demand for the refined petroleum products that we produce. If changes in law, regulations or industry standards occur that result in requirements to reduce the volatile or flammable constituents in crude oil that is transported by rail, alter the design or standards for rail cars, change the routing or scheduling of trains carrying crude oil, or any other changes that detrimentally affect the economics of delivering North American crude oil by rail to our refineries, our costs could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We could incur substantial costs or disruptions in our business if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations or otherwise comply with health, safety, environmental and other laws and regulations. 
 Our operations require numerous permits and authorizations under various laws and regulations. Any or all of these matters could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may incur significant liability under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, environmental and health and safety regulations, which are complex and change frequently. 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. 
 We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. 
 Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several liability for, costs of investigation and cleanup of such spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future releases or spills, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean-up obligations, the liability to third parties for damage to their property, or the need to address newly-discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 We caution you that the foregoing list of important factors may not contain all of the material factors that are important to you. 
 Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 Overview 
 Our earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price of refined petroleum products ultimately sold depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline, diesel and other refined petroleum products, which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in global and regional economies, weather conditions, global and regional political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels, pipeline capacity, prevailing exchange rates and the extent of government regulation. Our revenue and operating income fluctuate significantly with movements in industry refined petroleum product prices, our materials cost fluctuate significantly with movements in crude oil prices and our other operating expenses fluctuate with movements in the price of energy to meet the power needs of our refineries. 
 Our operating cost structure is also important to our profitability. Major operating costs include costs relating to employees and contract labor, energy, maintenance and environmental compliance, and renewable fuel credits, known as RINs, required for compliance with the Renewable Fuels Standard. The predominant variable cost is energy, in particular, the price of utilities, natural gas and chemicals. Our operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2012 included our net income of 804.0 million, plus net non-cash charges relating to depreciation and amortization of 97.7 million, pension and other post retirement benefits of 12.7 million, changes in the fair value of our catalyst lease and Toledo contingent consideration obligations of 6.4 million, change in the fair value of our inventory repurchase obligations of 4.6 million, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to retired debt of 4.4 million and stock-based compensation of 2.9 million, partially offset by a gain on sales of assets of 2.3 million. In addition, net changes in working capital used 118.0 million in cash driven by increases in hydrocarbon purchases and sales volumes and their associated impact on inventory, accounts receivable, and hydrocarbon-related liabilities. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 812.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 249.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. 
 As of December 31, 2013, the ABL Revolving Credit Facility provided for revolving loans of up to an aggregate of 1.610 billion, a portion of which was available in the form of letters of credit. The amount available for borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is calculated according to a borrowing base formula based on (1) 90 of the book value of eligible accounts receivable with respect to investment grade obligors plus (2) 85 of the book value of eligible accounts receivable with respect to non-investment grade obligors plus (3) 80 of the cost of eligible hydrocarbon inventory plus (4) 100 of cash and cash equivalents in deposit accounts subject to a control agreement. The borrowing base is subject to customary reserves and eligibility criteria and in any event cannot exceed 1.610 billion. 
 All obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed (solely on a limited recourse basis) to the extent required to support the lien described in clause (y) below by PBF LLC, PBF Finance, and each of our domestic operating subsidiaries and secured by a lien on (y) PBF LLC s equity interests in PBF Holding and (z) substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exceptions). The lien of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is secured by: all deposit accounts (other than zero balance accounts, cash collateral accounts, trust accounts and/or payroll accounts, all of which are excluded from the collateral); all accounts receivables; all hydrocarbon inventory (other than the Saudi crude oil pledged under the letter of credit facility); to the extent evidencing, governing, securing or otherwise related to the foregoing, all general intangibles, chattel paper, instruments, documents, letter of credit rights and supporting obligations; and all products and proceeds of the foregoing. 
 Letter of Credit Facility 
 PBF Holding, Paulsboro Refining and Delaware City Refining were party to a letter of credit facility with BNP Paribas (Suisse) SA, or BNP. We also had 12.1 million in restricted cash, which was included within deferred charges and other assets, net on our balance sheet. The restricted cash represents a trust fund we acquired in connection with the Paulsboro refinery acquisition and represents the estimated cost of environmental remediation obligations assumed. 
 Liquidity 
 As of December 31, 2013 , our total liquidity was approximately 615.9 million, compared to total liquidity of approximately 599.2 million as of December 31, 2012. We spent approximately 30.7 million through December 31, 2013 related to these capital projects and estimate aggregate total capital expenditures of approximately 85.0 million through the end of 2015.

(a) 
 Long-term Debt and Interest Payments on Debt Facilities 
 Long-term obligations represent (i) the repayment of the outstanding revolving credit agreement; (ii) the repayment of indebtedness incurred in connection with the senior secured notes offering; and (iii) the repayment of our catalyst lease obligations on their maturity dates. 
 Interest payments on debt facilities include cash interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes, catalyst lease obligations, plus cash payments for the commitment fee on the unused ABL Revolving Credit Facility and letter of credit fees on the letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2013. The amounts included in this table are based on fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and the fixed or estimated costs based on market conditions as of December 31, 2013. 
 
 (e) 
 Environmental Obligations 
 In connection with the Paulsboro acquisition, we assumed certain environmental remediation obligations to address existing soil and groundwater contamination at the site and acquired a trust fund established to meet the state s related financial assurance requirement, recorded as a liability in the amount of 12.1 million which reflects the present value of the current estimated cost of the remediation obligations assumed based on investigative work to-date. The undiscounted estimated costs related to these environmental remediation obligations were 14.9 million as of December 31, 2013. 
 In connection with the acquisition of the Delaware City assets, the prior owners remain responsible, subject to certain limitations, for certain pre-acquisition environmental obligations, including ongoing soil and groundwater remediation at the site. 
 65 

In connection with the Delaware City assets and Paulsboro refinery acquisitions, we, along with the seller, purchased two individual ten year, 75.0 million environmental insurance policies to insure against unknown environmental liabilities at each site. 
 In connection with the acquisition of Toledo, the seller initially retains, subject to certain limitations, remediation obligations which will transition to us over a 20-year period. 
 In connection with the acquisition of all three of our refineries, we assumed certain environmental obligations under regulatory orders unique to each site, including orders regulating air emissions from each facility. 
 
 (f) 
 Pension and Post-retirement Obligations 
 Pension and post-retirement obligations include only those amounts we expect to pay out in benefit payments and are further explained at the Employee Benefit Plans footnote to our financial statements, Item 8. The accrued liability is based on the period-end market value, as it represents our best estimate of what we will pay for the crude oil. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Liabilities for future clean-up costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or clean-up efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. The actual settlement of our liability for environmental matters could materially differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties such as the extent of contamination, changes in environmental laws and regulations, potential improvements in remediation technologies and the participation of other responsible parties. 
 Long-Lived Assets and Definite-Lived Intangibles

The amount available for borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is calculated according to a borrowing base formula based on (1) 90 of the book value of eligible accounts receivable with respect to investment grade obligors plus (2) 85 of the book value of eligible accounts receivable with respect to non-investment grade obligors plus (3) 80 of the cost of eligible hydrocarbon inventory plus (4) 100 of cash and cash equivalents in deposit accounts subject to a control agreement. The borrowing base is subject to customary reserves and eligibility criteria and in any event cannot exceed 1.610 billion. 
 All obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed (solely on a limited recourse basis) to the extent required to support the lien described in clause (y) below by PBF LLC, PBF Finance, and each of our domestic operating subsidiaries and secured by a lien on (y) PBF LLC s equity interests in PBF Holding and (z) substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exceptions). The lien of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is secured by: all deposit accounts (other than zero balance accounts, cash collateral accounts, trust accounts and/or payroll accounts, all of which are excluded from the collateral); all accounts receivables; all hydrocarbon inventory (other than the Saudi crude oil pledged under the letter of credit facility); to the extent evidencing, governing, securing or otherwise related to the foregoing, all general intangibles, chattel paper, instruments, documents, letter of credit rights and supporting obligations; and all products and proceeds of the foregoing. 
 Letter of Credit Facility 
 PBF Holding, Paulsboro Refining and Delaware City Refining were party to a letter of credit facility with BNP Paribas (Suisse) SA, or BNP. We also had 12.1 million in restricted cash, which was included within deferred charges and other assets, net on our balance sheet. The restricted cash represents a trust fund we acquired in connection with the Paulsboro refinery acquisition and represents the estimated cost of environmental remediation obligations assumed. 
 Liquidity 
 As of December 31, 2013 , our total liquidity was approximately 615.9 million, compared to total liquidity of approximately 599.2 million as of December 31, 2012. We spent approximately 30.7 million through December 31, 2013 related to these capital projects and estimate aggregate total capital expenditures of approximately 85.0 million through the end of 2015.

(a) 
 Long-term Debt and Interest Payments on Debt Facilities 
 Long-term obligations represent (i) the repayment of the outstanding revolving credit agreement; (ii) the repayment of indebtedness incurred in connection with the senior secured notes offering; and (iii) the repayment of our catalyst lease obligations on their maturity dates. 
 Interest payments on debt facilities include cash interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes, catalyst lease obligations, plus cash payments for the commitment fee on the unused ABL Revolving Credit Facility and letter of credit fees on the letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2013. The amounts included in this table are based on fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and the fixed or estimated costs based on market conditions as of December 31, 2013. 
 
 (e) 
 Environmental Obligations 
 In connection with the Paulsboro acquisition, we assumed certain environmental remediation obligations to address existing soil and groundwater contamination at the site and acquired a trust fund established to meet the state s related financial assurance requirement, recorded as a liability in the amount of 12.1 million which reflects the present value of the current estimated cost of the remediation obligations assumed based on investigative work to-date. The undiscounted estimated costs related to these environmental remediation obligations were 14.9 million as of December 31, 2013. 
 In connection with the acquisition of the Delaware City assets, the prior owners remain responsible, subject to certain limitations, for certain pre-acquisition environmental obligations, including ongoing soil and groundwater remediation at the site. 
 65 

In connection with the Delaware City assets and Paulsboro refinery acquisitions, we, along with the seller, purchased two individual ten year, 75.0 million environmental insurance policies to insure against unknown environmental liabilities at each site. 
 In connection with the acquisition of Toledo, the seller initially retains, subject to certain limitations, remediation obligations which will transition to us over a 20-year period. 
 In connection with the acquisition of all three of our refineries, we assumed certain environmental obligations under regulatory orders unique to each site, including orders regulating air emissions from each facility. 
 
 (f) 
 Pension and Post-retirement Obligations 
 Pension and post-retirement obligations include only those amounts we expect to pay out in benefit payments and are further explained at the Employee Benefit Plans footnote to our financial statements, Item 8. The accrued liability is based on the period-end market value, as it represents our best estimate of what we will pay for the crude oil. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Liabilities for future clean-up costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or clean-up efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. The actual settlement of our liability for environmental matters could materially differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties such as the extent of contamination, changes in environmental laws and regulations, potential improvements in remediation technologies and the participation of other responsible parties. 
 Long-Lived Assets and Definite-Lived Intangibles

 We caution you that the foregoing list of important factors may not contain all of the material factors that are important to you. 
 Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 Overview 
 Our earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price of refined petroleum products ultimately sold depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline, diesel and other refined petroleum products, which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in global and regional economies, weather conditions, global and regional political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels, pipeline capacity, prevailing exchange rates and the extent of government regulation. Our revenue and operating income fluctuate significantly with movements in industry refined petroleum product prices, our materials cost fluctuate significantly with movements in crude oil prices and our other operating expenses fluctuate with movements in the price of energy to meet the power needs of our refineries. 
 Our operating cost structure is also important to our profitability. Major operating costs include costs relating to employees and contract labor, energy, maintenance and environmental compliance, and renewable fuel credits, known as RINs, required for compliance with the Renewable Fuels Standard. The predominant variable cost is energy, in particular, the price of utilities, natural gas and chemicals. Our operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2012 included our net income of 804.0 million, plus net non-cash charges relating to depreciation and amortization of 97.7 million, pension and other post retirement benefits of 12.7 million, changes in the fair value of our catalyst lease and Toledo contingent consideration obligations of 6.4 million, change in the fair value of our inventory repurchase obligations of 4.6 million, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to retired debt of 4.4 million and stock-based compensation of 2.9 million, partially offset by a gain on sales of assets of 2.3 million. In addition, net changes in working capital used 118.0 million in cash driven by increases in hydrocarbon purchases and sales volumes and their associated impact on inventory, accounts receivable, and hydrocarbon-related liabilities. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 812.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 249.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. 
 As of December 31, 2013, the ABL Revolving Credit Facility provided for revolving loans of up to an aggregate of 1.610 billion, a portion of which was available in the form of letters of credit. The amount available for borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is calculated according to a borrowing base formula based on (1) 90 of the book value of eligible accounts receivable with respect to investment grade obligors plus (2) 85 of the book value of eligible accounts receivable with respect to non-investment grade obligors plus (3) 80 of the cost of eligible hydrocarbon inventory plus (4) 100 of cash and cash equivalents in deposit accounts subject to a control agreement. The borrowing base is subject to customary reserves and eligibility criteria and in any event cannot exceed 1.610 billion. 
 All obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed (solely on a limited recourse basis) to the extent required to support the lien described in clause (y) below by PBF LLC, PBF Finance, and each of our domestic operating subsidiaries and secured by a lien on (y) PBF LLC s equity interests in PBF Holding and (z) substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exceptions). The lien of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is secured by: all deposit accounts (other than zero balance accounts, cash collateral accounts, trust accounts and/or payroll accounts, all of which are excluded from the collateral); all accounts receivables; all hydrocarbon inventory (other than the Saudi crude oil pledged under the letter of credit facility); to the extent evidencing, governing, securing or otherwise related to the foregoing, all general intangibles, chattel paper, instruments, documents, letter of credit rights and supporting obligations; and all products and proceeds of the foregoing.

 In connection with the acquisition of all three of our refineries, we assumed certain environmental obligations under regulatory orders unique to each site, including orders regulating air emissions from each facility. 
 
 (f) 
 Pension and Post-retirement Obligations 
 Pension and post-retirement obligations include only those amounts we expect to pay out in benefit payments and are further explained at the Employee Benefit Plans footnote to our financial statements, Item 8. The accrued liability is based on the period-end market value, as it represents our best estimate of what we will pay for the crude oil. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Liabilities for future clean-up costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or clean-up efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. The actual settlement of our liability for environmental matters could materially differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties such as the extent of contamination, changes in environmental laws and regulations, potential improvements in remediation technologies and the participation of other responsible parties. 
 Long-Lived Assets and Definite-Lived Intangibles 
 We review our long and finite lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable.","Matthew Lucey. 
 Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
 Refinery and pipeline operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of matter into the environment or otherwise relating to human health and safety or the protection of the environment. These laws regulate, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum and other regulated 
 14 

materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, remediation of contaminated sites, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Permits are also required under these laws for the operation of our refineries, pipelines and related operations and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. Compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits will continue to have an impact on our operations, results of operations and capital requirements. We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws, regulations and permits. 
 Our operations and many of the products we manufacture are subject to certain specific requirements of the CAA, and related state and local regulations. 
 Additionally, as of January 1, 2011 we are required to meet an EPA regulation limiting the average sulfur content in gasoline to 30 PPM. The EPA has also announced that it plans to propose new Tier 3 motor vehicle emission and fuel standards. It has been reported that these new Tier 3 regulations may, among other things, lower the maximum average sulfur content of gasoline from 30 PPM to 10 PPM. In addition, the renewable fuel standards mandate the blending of prescribed percentages of renewable fuels (e.g., ethanol and biofuels) into our produced gasoline and diesel. These new requirements, other requirements of the CAA and other presently existing or future environmental regulations may cause us to make substantial capital expenditures as well as the purchase of credits at significant cost, to enable our refineries to produce products that meet applicable requirements. 
 Our operations are also subject to the federal Clean Water Act, or the CWA, the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or the SDWA, and comparable state and local requirements. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. 
 The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as Superfund, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances. In our current normal operations, we have generated waste, some of which falls within the statutory definition of a hazardous substance and some of which may have been disposed of at sites that may require cleanup under Superfund. 
 As is the case with all companies engaged in industries similar to ours, we face potential exposure to future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters. These matters include soil and water contamination, air pollution, 
 15 

personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by substances which we manufactured, handled, used, released or disposed of. 
 Current and future environmental regulations are expected to require additional expenditures, including expenditures for investigation and remediation, which may be significant, at our refineries and at our other facilities. To the extent that future expenditures for these purposes are material and can be reasonably determined, these costs are disclosed and accrued. Compliance with applicable health and safety laws and regulations has required and continues to require substantial expenditures. 
 In connection with each of our acquisitions, we assumed certain environmental remediation obligations. In the case of Paulsboro, a trust fund established to meet state financial assurance requirements, in the amount of approximately 12.1 million, the estimated cost of the remediation obligations assumed based on investigation undertaken as of the acquisition date, was acquired as part of the acquisition. The short term portion of the trust fund and corresponding liability are recorded as restricted cash and accrued expenses, the long term portion is recorded in other assets and other long-term liabilities. In connection with the acquisition of Delaware City, the prior owners remain responsible subject to certain limitations, for certain environmental obligations including ongoing remediation of soil and groundwater contamination at the site. Further, in connection with the Delaware City and Paulsboro acquisitions, we purchased two individual ten-year, 75.0 million environmental insurance policies to insure against unknown environmental liabilities at each refinery. In connection with the acquisition of Toledo, the seller, subject to certain limitations, initially retains remediation obligations which will transition to us over a 20-year period. However, there can be no assurance that any available indemnity, trust fund or insurance will be sufficient to cover any ultimate environmental liabilities we may incur with respect to our refineries, which could be significant. 
 We cannot predict what additional health, safety and environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations or adverse changes in the interpretation of existing requirements or discovery of new information such as unknown contamination could have an adverse effect on the financial position and the results of our operations and could require substantial expenditures for the installation and operation of systems and equipment that we do not currently possess. The opposite of the downstream sector is the upstream sector, which refers to exploration and production companies that search for and/or produce crude oil and natural gas underground or through drilling or exploratory wells. 
 EPA refers to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
 ethanol refers to a clear, colorless, flammable oxygenated liquid. 
 FCU refers to fluid coking unit. 
 GHG refers to greenhouse gas. 
 Group I base oils or lubricants refers to conventionally refined products characterized by a sulfur content less than 0.03 with a viscosity index between 80 and 120. Light crude oils require lower levels of processing to produce high value products such as gasoline and diesel. 
 light products refers to the group of refined products with lower boiling temperatures, including gasoline and distillates. 
 light-heavy differential refers to the price difference between light crude oil and heavy crude oil. 
 Prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, blendstocks, and refined products depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, other feedstocks, gasoline, diesel, ethanol, asphalt and other refined products. Such supply and demand are affected by a variety of economic, market, environmental and political conditions. 
 19 

Our direct operating expense structure also impacts our profitability. The Toledo refinery, or one of our other refineries, may continue to disproportionally affect our results of operations in the future. Any prolonged disruption to the operations of such refinery, whether due to labor difficulties, destruction of or damage to such facilities, severe weather conditions, interruption of utilities service or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 20 

A significant interruption or casualty loss at any of our refineries and related assets could reduce our production, particularly if not fully covered by our insurance. 
 Our business currently consists of owning and operating three refineries and related assets. As a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if any of our refineries were to experience a major accident, be damaged by severe weather or other natural disaster, or otherwise be forced to shut down or curtail production due to unforeseen events, such as acts of God, nature, orders of governmental authorities, supply chain disruptions impacting our crude rail facilities or other logistical assets, power outages, acts of terrorism, fires, toxic emissions and maritime hazards. Any such shutdown or disruption would reduce the production from that refinery. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, coverage for hurricane damage can be limited, and coverage for terrorism risks can include broad exclusions. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. and Buckeye Partners L.P. We could experience an interruption of supply or delivery, or an increased cost of receiving crude oil and delivering refined products to market, if the ability of these pipelines to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of accidents, weather interruptions, governmental regulation, terrorism, other third party action or casualty or other of events. 
 In addition, due to the common carrier regulatory obligation applicable to interstate oil pipelines, capacity is prorated among shippers in accordance with the tariff then in effect in the event there are nominations in excess of capacity. 
 We may have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate. 
 If we cannot generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short-term and long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations or our future debt obligations, comply with certain deadlines related to environmental regulations and standards, or pursue our business strategies, including acquisitions, 
 21 

in which case our operations may not perform as we currently expect. We have substantial short-term capital needs and may have substantial long term capital needs. 
 In addition, from time to time, we are required to spend significant amounts for repairs when one or more processing units experiences temporary shutdowns. We continue to utilize significant capital to upgrade equipment, improve facilities, and reduce operational, safety and environmental risks. In connection with the Paulsboro acquisition, we assumed certain significant environmental obligations, and may similarly do so in future acquisitions. We will likely incur substantial compliance costs in connection with new or changing environmental, health and safety regulations. See Item 7. As a result, we are more susceptible to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors and any unforeseen events or circumstances that affect the area could also materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability. These factors include, among other things, changes in the economy, damages to infrastructure, weather conditions, demographics and population. 
 23 

We must make substantial capital expenditures on our operating facilities to maintain their reliability and efficiency. 
 Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of new facilities (or improvements and repairs to our existing facilities and equipment) could adversely affect our ability to achieve targeted internal rates of return and operating results. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors in the marketplace, many of which are beyond our control, including: 
 
 denial or delay in issuing regulatory approvals and/or permits; 
 
 unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor; 
 
 disruptions in transportation of modular components and/or construction materials; 
 
 severe adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors and suppliers; 
 
 shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; 
 
 market-related increases in a project s debt or equity financing costs; and/or 
 
 non-performance or force majeure by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or sub-contractors involved with a project. 
 Our refineries contain many processing units, a number of which have been in operation for many years. Our ability to do so will be dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms, successfully integrate acquired assets and obtain financing to fund acquisitions and to support our growth and many other factors beyond our control. Risks associated with acquisitions include those relating to the diversion of management time and attention from our existing business, liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities and greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental, safety or other regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures relating to acquired assets. We may also enter into transition services agreements in the future with sellers of any additional refineries we acquire. Moreover, such transactions may limit our ability to benefit from favorable changes in crude oil and refined product prices. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: 
 
 the volumes of our actual use of crude oil or production of the applicable refined products is less than the volumes subject to the hedging arrangement; 
 
 accidents, interruptions in feedstock transportation, inclement weather or other events cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refineries, or those of our suppliers or customers; 
 
 changes in commodity prices have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our hedging arrangements, resulting in our being subject to margin calls; 
 
 the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or 
 
 a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts the commodity or crack spread subject to the hedging arrangement. 
 As a result, the effectiveness of our hedging strategy could have a material impact on our financial results. If a key system was hacked or otherwise interfered with by an unauthorized access, or was to fail or experience unscheduled downtime for any reason, even if only for a short period, our operations and financial results could be affected adversely. Our systems could be damaged or interrupted by a security breach, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure or similar event. We have a formal disaster recovery plan in place, but this plan may not prevent delays or other complications that could arise from an information systems failure. Product liability claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. 
 We may incur significant liability under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, environmental and health and safety regulations, which are complex and change frequently. 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. 
 We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. 
 Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several, liability for costs of investigation and cleanup of such spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at, contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future releases or spills, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean-up obligations, the liability to third parties for damage to their property, or the need to address newly-discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Furthermore, our Delaware City refinery and our Delaware City Rail Terminal are located in Delaware's coastal zone where certain activities are regulated under the Delaware Coastal Zone Act and closely monitored by environmental interest groups. On June 14, 2013, two administrative appeals were filed by the Sierra Club and Delaware Audubon regarding a permit Delaware City Refining Company LLC DCR obtained to allow loading of crude oil onto barges. The appeals allege that both the loading of crude oil onto barges and the operation of the Delaware City rail unloading terminal violate Delaware s Coastal Zone Act. The first appeal is Number 2013-1 before the State Coastal Zone Industrial Control Board (the CZ Board ), and the second appeal is before the Environmental Appeals Board and appeals Secretary s Order No. 2013-A-0020. Briefs are due to be filed in this appeal in the first quarter of 2014 but no date has been set for a decision by the Superior Court. A hearing on the second appeal before the Environmental Appeals Board, case no. 2013-06, was held on January 13, 2014, and the Board ruled in favor of Delaware City Refining and the State and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. If the Appellants in one or both of these matters ultimately prevail, the outcome may have an adverse material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Environmental clean-up and remediation costs of our sites and environmental litigation could decrease our net cash flow, reduce our results of operations and impair our financial condition. 
 We are subject to liability for the investigation and clean-up of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own or operate and at off-site locations where we arrange for the treatment or disposal of regulated materials. We may become involved in future litigation or other proceedings. Currently remediation projects are underway in accordance with regulatory requirements at the Paulsboro and Delaware City refineries. In connection with the acquisitions of our refineries, the prior owners have retained certain liabilities or indemnified us for certain liabilities, including those relating to pre-acquisition soil and groundwater conditions, and in some instances we have assumed certain liabilities and environmental obligations, including certain remediation obligations at the Paulsboro refinery. If the prior owners fail to satisfy their obligations for any reason, or if significant liabilities arise in the areas in which we assumed liability, we may become responsible for remediation expenses and other environmental liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. As a result, in addition to making capital expenditures or incurring other costs to comply with environmental laws, we also may be liable for significant environmental litigation or for investigation and remediation costs and other liabilities arising from the ownership or operation of these assets by prior owners, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations and Commitments and Item 1. Business Environmental, Health and Safety Matters. 
 We may also face liability arising from current or future claims alleging personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other regulated materials, such as asbestos, benzene, MTBE and petroleum hydrocarbons, at or from our facilities. We may also face liability for personal injury, property damage, natural resource damage or clean-up costs for the alleged migration of contamination from our properties. A significant increase in the number or success of these claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 
 Regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases could force us to incur increased capital and operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, including proposals to: (i) establish a cap and trade system, (ii) create a federal renewable energy or clean energy standard requiring electric utilities to provide a certain percentage of power from such sources, and (iii) create enhanced incentives for use of renewable energy and increased efficiency in energy supply and use. In addition, the EPA is taking steps to regulate GHGs under the existing federal Clean Air Act, or CAA. The EPA has already adopted regulations limiting emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles, addressing the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources, and requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources, including refineries. These and similar regulations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report GHG emissions or reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. In addition, various states, individually as well as in some cases on a regional basis, have taken steps to control GHG emissions, including adoption of GHG reporting requirements, cap and trade systems and renewable portfolio standards. Efforts have also been undertaken to delay, limit or prohibit EPA and possibly state action to regulate GHG emissions, and it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate form, timing or extent of federal or state regulation. In the event we do incur increased costs as a result of increased efforts to control GHG emissions, we may not be able to pass on any of these costs to our customers. Such requirements also could adversely affect demand for the refined petroleum products that we produce. If changes in law, regulations or industry standards occur that result in requirements to reduce the volatile or flammable constituents in crude oil that is transported by rail, alter the design or standards for rail cars, change the routing or scheduling of trains carrying crude oil, or any other changes that detrimentally affect the economics of delivering North American crude oil by rail to our refineries, our costs could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We could incur substantial costs or disruptions in our business if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations or otherwise comply with health, safety, environmental and other laws and regulations. 
 Our operations require numerous permits and authorizations under various laws and regulations. Any or all of these matters could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may incur significant liability under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, environmental and health and safety regulations, which are complex and change frequently. 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. 
 We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. 
 Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several liability for, costs of investigation and cleanup of such spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future releases or spills, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean-up obligations, the liability to third parties for damage to their property, or the need to address newly-discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Furthermore, our Delaware City refinery and our Delaware City Rail Terminal are located in Delaware's coastal zone where certain activities are regulated under the Delaware Coastal Zone Act and closely monitored by environmental interest groups. On June 14, 2013, two administrative appeals were filed by the Sierra Club and Delaware Audubon regarding a permit Delaware City Refining Company LLC DCR obtained to allow loading of crude oil onto barges. The appeals allege that both the loading of crude oil onto barges and the operation of the Delaware City rail unloading terminal violate Delaware s Coastal Zone Act.

 We caution you that the foregoing list of important factors may not contain all of the material factors that are important to you. 
 Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 Overview 
 Our earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price of refined petroleum products ultimately sold depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline, diesel and other refined petroleum products, which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in global and regional economies, weather conditions, global and regional political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels, pipeline capacity, prevailing exchange rates and the extent of government regulation. Our revenue and operating income fluctuate significantly with movements in industry refined petroleum product prices, our materials cost fluctuate significantly with movements in crude oil prices and our other operating expenses fluctuate with movements in the price of energy to meet the power needs of our refineries. 
 Our operating cost structure is also important to our profitability. Major operating costs include costs relating to employees and contract labor, energy, maintenance and environmental compliance, and renewable fuel credits, known as RINs, required for compliance with the Renewable Fuels Standard. The predominant variable cost is energy, in particular, the price of utilities, natural gas and chemicals. Our operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2012 included our net income of 804.0 million, plus net non-cash charges relating to depreciation and amortization of 97.7 million, pension and other post retirement benefits of 12.7 million, changes in the fair value of our catalyst lease and Toledo contingent consideration obligations of 6.4 million, change in the fair value of our inventory repurchase obligations of 4.6 million, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to retired debt of 4.4 million and stock-based compensation of 2.9 million, partially offset by a gain on sales of assets of 2.3 million. In addition, net changes in working capital used 118.0 million in cash driven by increases in hydrocarbon purchases and sales volumes and their associated impact on inventory, accounts receivable, and hydrocarbon-related liabilities. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 812.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 249.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. 
 As of December 31, 2013, the ABL Revolving Credit Facility provided for revolving loans of up to an aggregate of 1.610 billion, a portion of which was available in the form of letters of credit. The amount available for borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is calculated according to a borrowing base formula based on (1) 90 of the book value of eligible accounts receivable with respect to investment grade obligors plus (2) 85 of the book value of eligible accounts receivable with respect to non-investment grade obligors plus (3) 80 of the cost of eligible hydrocarbon inventory plus (4) 100 of cash and cash equivalents in deposit accounts subject to a control agreement. The borrowing base is subject to customary reserves and eligibility criteria and in any event cannot exceed 1.610 billion. 
 All obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed (solely on a limited recourse basis) to the extent required to support the lien described in clause (y) below by PBF LLC, PBF Finance, and each of our domestic operating subsidiaries and secured by a lien on (y) PBF LLC s equity interests in PBF Holding and (z) substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exceptions). The lien of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is secured by: all deposit accounts (other than zero balance accounts, cash collateral accounts, trust accounts and/or payroll accounts, all of which are excluded from the collateral); all accounts receivables; all hydrocarbon inventory (other than the Saudi crude oil pledged under the letter of credit facility); to the extent evidencing, governing, securing or otherwise related to the foregoing, all general intangibles, chattel paper, instruments, documents, letter of credit rights and supporting obligations; and all products and proceeds of the foregoing. 
 Letter of Credit Facility 
 PBF Holding, Paulsboro Refining and Delaware City Refining were party to a letter of credit facility with BNP Paribas (Suisse) SA, or BNP. We also had 12.1 million in restricted cash, which was included within deferred charges and other assets, net on our balance sheet. The restricted cash represents a trust fund we acquired in connection with the Paulsboro refinery acquisition and represents the estimated cost of environmental remediation obligations assumed. 
 Liquidity 
 As of December 31, 2013 , our total liquidity was approximately 615.9 million, compared to total liquidity of approximately 599.2 million as of December 31, 2012. We spent approximately 30.7 million through December 31, 2013 related to these capital projects and estimate aggregate total capital expenditures of approximately 85.0 million through the end of 2015.

 Long-term obligations represent (i) the repayment of the outstanding revolving credit agreement; (ii) the repayment of indebtedness incurred in connection with the senior secured notes offering; and (iii) the repayment of our catalyst lease obligations on their maturity dates. 
 Interest payments on debt facilities include cash interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes, catalyst lease obligations, plus cash payments for the commitment fee on the unused ABL Revolving Credit Facility and letter of credit fees on the letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2013. The amounts included in this table are based on fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and the fixed or estimated costs based on market conditions as of December 31, 2013. 
 
 (e) 
 Environmental Obligations 
 In connection with the Paulsboro acquisition, we assumed certain environmental remediation obligations to address existing soil and groundwater contamination at the site and acquired a trust fund established to meet the state s related financial assurance requirement, recorded as a liability in the amount of 12.1 million which reflects the present value of the current estimated cost of the remediation obligations assumed based on investigative work to-date. The undiscounted estimated costs related to these environmental remediation obligations were 14.9 million as of December 31, 2013. 
 In connection with the acquisition of the Delaware City assets, the prior owners remain responsible, subject to certain limitations, for certain pre-acquisition environmental obligations, including ongoing soil and groundwater remediation at the site. 
 65 

In connection with the Delaware City assets and Paulsboro refinery acquisitions, we, along with the seller, purchased two individual ten year, 75.0 million environmental insurance policies to insure against unknown environmental liabilities at each site. 
 In connection with the acquisition of Toledo, the seller initially retains, subject to certain limitations, remediation obligations which will transition to us over a 20-year period. 
 In connection with the acquisition of all three of our refineries, we assumed certain environmental obligations under regulatory orders unique to each site, including orders regulating air emissions from each facility. 
 
 (f) 
 Pension and Post-retirement Obligations 
 Pension and post-retirement obligations include only those amounts we expect to pay out in benefit payments and are further explained at the Employee Benefit Plans footnote to our financial statements, Item 8. The accrued liability is based on the period-end market value, as it represents our best estimate of what we will pay for the crude oil. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Liabilities for future clean-up costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or clean-up efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. The actual settlement of our liability for environmental matters could materially differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties such as the extent of contamination, changes in environmental laws and regulations, potential improvements in remediation technologies and the participation of other responsible parties. 
 Long-Lived Assets and Definite-Lived Intangibles 
 We review our long and finite lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. The accrued liability is based on the period-end market value, as it represents our best estimate of what we will pay for the crude oil.

,"Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food commodities, including among other things beef, poultry, grains, dairy and produce. Prices may be affected due to market changes, increased competition, the general risk of inflation, shortages or interruptions in supply due to weather, disease or other conditions beyond our control, or other reasons. Other events could increase commodity prices or cause shortages that could affect the cost and quality of the items we buy or require us to further raise prices or limit our menu options. As we operate more shops, our rate of expansion relative to the size of our restaurant base will eventually decline. 
 The number and timing of new shops opened during any given period may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, without limitation: 

the identification and availability of attractive sites for new shops and the ability to negotiate suitable lease terms; 

competition in new markets, including competition for appropriate sites; 

 15 

anticipated commercial, residential and infrastructure development near our new shops; 

the proximity of potential sites to an existing shop; 

the cost and availability of capital to fund construction costs and pre-opening expenses; 

our ability to control construction and development costs of new shops; 

recruitment and training of qualified operating personnel in the local market; 

our ability to obtain all required governmental permits, including zoning approvals, on a timely basis; 

unanticipated increases in costs, any of which could give rise to delays or cost overruns; and 

avoiding the impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities. 

 We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand or acquire critical market presence for our brand in new geographical markets, as we may encounter well-established competitors with substantially greater financial resources. As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. 
 Because many of our shops are concentrated in local or regional areas, we are susceptible to economic and other trends and developments, including adverse weather conditions, in these areas. 
 Our financial performance is highly dependent on shops located in Illinois, Texas, Michigan, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., which comprised approximately 62 of our total domestic shops as of December 25, 2016. In addition, given our geographic concentrations, negative publicity regarding any of our shops in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, as could other regional occurrences such as local strikes, terrorist attacks, increases in energy prices, or natural or man-made disasters. 
 In particular, adverse weather conditions, such as regional winter storms, floods, severe thunderstorms and hurricanes, could negatively impact our results of operations. For example, during the first quarter of 2014, nearly 80 of our shops were located in areas that were negatively impacted by extreme cold temperatures, heavy snowfall, or a combination of both, for a majority of the operating days in that fiscal quarter. Temporary or prolonged shop closures may occur and customer traffic may decline due to the actual or perceived effects of future weather related events. 
 Legislation and regulations requiring the display and provision of nutritional information for our menu offerings, and new information or attitudes regarding diet and health or adverse opinions about the health effects of consuming our menu offerings, could affect consumer preferences and negatively impact our results of operations. 
 The restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to building and zoning requirements and those relating to the preparation and sale of food. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards. 
 We are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh food products that meet our specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of fresh food products caused by problems in production or distribution, inclement weather, unanticipated demand or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which would adversely affect our operating results. 
 We have a limited number of suppliers for our major products and rely on a distribution network with a limited number of distribution partners for the majority of our national distribution program in the U.S. You may experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the value of your stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, and could lose part or all of your investment. The price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including those described elsewhere in this Annual Report and others such as: 

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results and the performance of our competitors; 

publication of research reports by securities analysts about us, our competitors or our industry; 

our failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market; 

additions and departures of key personnel; 

sales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock or of shares held by our stockholders, directors or executive officers; 

strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; 

the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry; 

speculation in the press or investment community, whether or not correct, involving us, our suppliers or our competitors; 

changes in accounting principles; 

litigation and governmental investigations; 

terrorist acts, acts of war or periods of widespread civil unrest; 

a food-borne illness outbreak; 

severe weather, natural disasters and other calamities; and 

changes in general market and economic conditions.

The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other similar things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty. 
 
 Environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved, and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.

 Our current and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment.

Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the United States, even if the sites outside the United States are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability. 
 
 As part of our acquisition of Varian, Inc. Varian we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian's costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters.

Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental-related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered unlikely. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products. 
 
 If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.

"We have received and
expect to continue to receive export licenses for our telemetry and control
equipment located outside the United States and for providing technical data to
potential launch contractors and developers of our next generation of
satellites. 

 Environmental
Matters 

 We are subject to various
laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human
health and safety (including those governing the management, storage and
disposal of hazardous materials). Some of our operations require continuous
power supply and, as a result, current and past operations at our teleport and
other technical facilities include fuel storage and batteries for back-up
generators. As an owner or operator of property and in connection with current
and historical operations at some of our sites, we could incur significant
costs, including cleanup costs, fines, sanctions and third-party claims,
as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and
regulations. 

 Additional
Information 

 We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy
statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the SEC ). We have not arranged this
financing and may not be able to so on acceptable terms. 

 A natural disaster could diminish our ability to
provide communications service. 

 Although our experience during the Hurricane Katrina
in 2005 showed the reliability and versatility of our system, natural disasters
could damage or destroy our ground stations resulting in a disruption of
service to our customers. We currently have the technology to safeguard our
antennas and protect our ground stations during natural disasters such as a
hurricane, but the collateral effects of such disasters such as flooding may
impair the functioning of our ground equipment. If a future natural disaster
impairs or destroys any of our ground facilities, we may be unable to provide
service to our customers in the affected area for a period of time. 

 In addition, even if our
gateways are not affected by natural disasters, our service could be disrupted
if a natural disaster damages the public switch telephone network or our
ability to connect to the public switch telephone network. We were able to make
the necessary adjustments during Hurricane Katrina because the public networks
serving our gateways in Texas and Florida were not damaged. 

 We may not be able
to launch our satellites successfully. Any such finding could reduce our
revenues and profitability and expose us and other wireless providers to
litigation, which, even if not successful, could be costly to defend. 

 If consumers health
concerns over radio frequency emissions increase, they may be discouraged from
using wireless handsets. Further, government authorities might increase
regulation of wireless handsets as a result of these health concerns. The
actual or perceived risk of radio frequency emissions could reduce our
subscriber growth rate, reduce the number of our subscribers or impair our
ability to obtain future financing. 

 Pursuing strategic
transactions may cause us to incur additional risks. We expect these
sales to result in higher service revenues to be recognized within the
subsequent twelve months. In 2005, we also experienced increasing demand for
our services driven by increased awareness of the need for reliable communication
services in 

46 

the wake of Hurricanes
Katrina, Rita and Wilma and the Asian tsunami. Although the majority of our
subscribers utilize our network principally for voice communication services,
an increasing portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of high and low
speed data services, including our Simplex one-way data transmission
service. We also sell related voice and data equipment to our
customers. We generated approximately 31 , 36 and 33 of our consolidated
revenues from subscriber equipment sales in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.
As a percentage of our revenue, equipment sales decreased in 2006 compared to
2005 primarily as a result of robust equipment sales in 2005 related to that
year s active hurricane season. As a percentage of revenue, equipment sales
increased faster than our service revenues in 2005, primarily as a result of
significant customer growth in our major markets and the annual plan effect
described above. April through October are
typically our peak months for service revenues and equipment sales. Government
customers in North America tend to use our services during summer months, often
in support of relief activities after events such as hurricanes, forest fires
and other natural disasters. 

49 

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates 

 The preparation of our
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect our revenues and expenses for the periods reported and the reported
amounts of our assets and liabilities, including contingent assets and
liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements. Subscriber
equipment sales decreased by 1.0 million, or approximately 2.3 , to
 44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 45.7
million for 2005. Sales in the year ended December 31, 2005 reflected
substantial buying in response to hurricane Katrina. 

 Operating Expenses. This growth was driven by increased demand for our
mobile voice services by governmental agencies and substantial customer growth
in all other markets. Our new pricing plans, which proved to be more attractive
to customers than prior plans, and the need for emergency communications
capabilities during 2005 s natural disasters contributed to this growth. We
also continued to maintain a stable average revenue per user and low churn
rate, compared to the prior period, both of which we believe contributed to our
overall revenue growth.","Customers typically use satellite voice and data communications in
situations where existing terrestrial wireline and wireless communications
networks are impaired or do not exist. Further, many regions of the world
benefit from satellite networks, such as rural and developing areas that lack
developed wireless or wireline networks, ocean regions, and regions affected by
political conflicts and natural disasters. Northern Sky Research stated in a
2006 report that, the MSS industry has proven to be invaluable in supporting
disaster preparedness and recovery activities, military applications, and other
critical civil requirements that require rapidly deployable, reliable and
ubiquitous communication services. 

 Worldwide, government organizations, military and
intelligence agencies, natural disaster aid associations, event-driven
response agencies and corporate security teams depend on mobile and fixed voice
and data communications services on a regular basis. Businesses with global
operating scope require reliable communications services when operating in
remote locations around the world. GEMCOMS operates like stand-alone
cellular phone sites. Prototypes of this system were made available to FEMA for
use in support of the disaster relief efforts for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and
Wilma. 

 Maritime. In Canada, we conduct business with the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police and with many additional federal and provincial agencies. Relief
agencies such as the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and FEMA generate
significant demand for both our voice and data products, especially during the
late summer months in anticipation of the hurricane season in North America.
Our Simplex service facilitates tracking and managing the distribution of
movable hard assets such as generators, trucks, trailers and relief supplies to
disaster areas, while our fixed and mobile voice terminals enable relief
workers and victims to communicate in areas where terrestrial service is no
longer operational. We provide customized communications solutions to various
departments of the U.S. Commercial fishing customers use voice
services as their primary communications to coordinate fishing locations with
other boats in their fleet and for ship-to-shore communications to arrange
docking times or order parts, check landing prices and manage onshore
operations. In addition, they use data services for weather and oceanic
conditions, which are key to improving their fishing productivity and
communicating with government fisheries departments. Commercial fishing users
are located primarily in the Pacific Northwest and northern Atlantic fishing
regions. We have received and
expect to continue to receive export licenses for our telemetry and control
equipment located outside the United States and for providing technical data to
potential launch contractors and developers of our next generation of

"The increase in
gross profit was primarily due to the revenue growth discussed above. The overall gross profit margin also increased in 2006 due primarily to: 

Higher mix of project outsourcing revenues, 

Increase in permanent placement revenues in Anders, 

Better management of state unemployment insurance SUI and workers compensation costs, 

An insurance refund of 0.7 million primarily related to workers compensation, and 

The absence of strong Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2006. The impact of the above items was partially offset by lower royalty revenues due to the sale of the international master franchise and continued higher mix of lower
margin business in the IT staffing business.","A significant portion of revenues is directly or indirectly derived from awards of long-term projects. It is difficult to predict whether and when
the Company will receive such awards due to the lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, financing arrangements, governmental approvals and environmental matters. Because
a meaningful portion of revenues is generated from projects, the Company s results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of contract awards. Any catastrophic occurrences in excess of insurance limits relating to locations or products which are engineered by the
Company or locations where its services are performed could result in significant professional liability, product liability, warranty and other claims against the Company. 
 Furthermore, the project outsourcing services CDI provides expose it to additional risks including equipment failures, personal injuries, property damage, and
unforeseen engineering, architectural and environmental problems, each of which could significantly impact the Company s performance and materially impact its financial statements. Changes in government regulations could result in loss of business and/or increased costs. Disasters could interfere with CDI s ability to operate its business. Certain of the

the Company s continued ability to operate its business normally. The Company services the oil, gas, and chemical industries, each of which have a significant concentration of activities in the Gulf Coast of the United States. This area can be impacted by severe weather, negatively impacting

"Sales at Dover were down 6 to 7.7 million and sales at REA decreased 28 to 1.0 million in the first three months of fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year period. These declines were largely due to the Borders bankruptcy and liquidation, which eliminated an important retail channel and has temporarily flooded the book market with low-priced inventory.

Sales and gross profit 
 
 Net sales increased 0.3 in 2016 to 276.6 million from 275.8 million in 2015 , primarily due to an increase in sales by our Kent Automotive and Government divisions, growing current strategic national account relationships and sales generated by acquisitions. This was partially offset by a general slow-down in the MRO marketplace, a decrease in the Canadian exchange rate and a decrease in sales of 2.6 million to oil and gas customers. These increases were partially offset by decreases across many other expense categories as a result of cost reduction efficiencies. 
 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 
 In 2015 we accrued 0.9 million related to estimated future remediation of an environmental matter involving land owned in Decatur, Alabama, that was part of a division that was previously sold in 2014. The estimated cost of remediation will most likely be adjusted in future years as more information becomes available.","Our ability to rapidly process customer orders is an integral component of our overall business strategy. Interruptions at our company operated facilities or disruptions at a major transportation center or shipping port, due to events such as severe weather, labor interruptions, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or other events, could affect our ability to maintain core products in inventory, deliver products to our customers on a timely basis or adversely affect demand for our products, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Changes in our customers, product mix and pricing strategy could cause our gross margin percentage to decline in the future. A decrease in the levels of defense and other governmental spending or the introduction of more stringent governmental regulations and oversight, could lead to reduced sales or an increase in compliance costs which would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.

A violation of federal, state or local environmental protection regulations could lead to significant penalties and fines or other remediation costs. 
 
 Our product offering includes a wide variety of industrial chemicals and other products which are subject to a multitude of federal, state and local regulations. These environmental protection laws change frequently and affect the composition, handling, transportation, storage and disposal of these products. Failure to comply with these regulations could lead to severe penalties and fines for each violation. 
 
 Additionally, a facility we own in Decatur, Alabama, was found to contain hazardous substances in the soil and groundwater as a result of historical operations prior to our ownership. We retained an environmental consulting firm to further investigate the contamination, including measurement and monitoring of the site. The Company has concluded that further remediation will most likely be required, and accordingly, has made an accrual for the estimated cost of this environmental matter. An agreement with Alabama s voluntary cleanup program has not yet been reached regarding these remediation approaches and additional procedures may be required to remediate the situation that could negatively impact our operating results.","[""If I look on a two-year stack basis for average daily sales on the legacy business, they're down about 100 basis points from 2Q.

"If current post referendum market conditions are sustained throughout the remainder of 2016, we believe it could have an adverse impact of up to 0.4 billion to the second half of 2016 of which approximately 0.1 billion is reflected in our third quarter results. 
 
 The German Ministry of Transportation and the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt have requested the participation of a number of automotive manufacturers, including our German subsidiary, in continuing discussions on emissions control issues and have also requested, from time to time, written responses from our subsidiary on the subject. Our German subsidiary has participated in these discussions and has provided the requested responses to inquiries concerning nitrogen oxide emission control systems of its diesel engines. In light of the foregoing, there could be further inquiries about nitrogen oxide and/or CO 2 emissions. These requests may lead to increased testing and re-testing of our vehicles and analysis of their emissions control systems, which could lead to increased costs, penalties, negative publicity or reputational impact, and additional vehicles may be subject to recall activity if regulators determine that emission levels and required regulatory compliance should be based on either a wider spectrum of driving conditions for future testing parameters or stricter or novel interpretations and consequent enforcement of existing requirements. No assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of any potential investigations or increased testing resulting from this scrutiny would not materially and adversely affect us. 
 
 Takata Matters On May 4, 2016 NHTSA issued an amended consent order requiring Takata to file DIRs for previously unrecalled front airbag inflators that contain an ammonium nitrate-based propellant without a moisture absorbing desiccant on a multi-year, risk-based schedule through 2019 impacting tens of millions of vehicles produced by numerous automotive manufacturers. NHTSA concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflators is a function of time, temperature cycling and environmental moisture. On May 16, 2016 Takata issued its first DIR in connection with the amended consent order. For example, the airbag inflators used in the vehicles are a variant engineered specifically for our vehicles, and include features such as greater venting, unique propellant wafer configurations, and machined steel end caps. The inflators are packaged in the instrument panel in such a way as to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system. Also, these vehicles have features that minimize the maximum temperature to which the inflator will be exposed, such as larger interior volumes and standard solar absorbing windshields and side glass. Further, our field deployment data contains no reports of inflator rupture in these vehicles during the estimated 55,000 field deployments that have occurred in these vehicles since the start of production or in the ballistic testing of inflators recovered from vehicles in the field.",,"['We had talked about 7% year-over-year.

We face continuing challenges from a market, operating and regulatory standpoint in a number of countries across the globe due to, among other factors, weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, emissions standards, foreign exchange volatility and political uncertainty. As a result of these conditions, we continue to strategically assess our performance and ability to achieve acceptable returns on our invested capital. We intend to mitigate these headwinds with the full benefit of our recently launched Astra and Mokka X along with the 2017 launches of the Insignia, Ampera E, and two new crossovers that we believe will substantially increase our competitiveness in this growing market.

from our two largest suppliers have ranged from approximately 11 to 12 of our total purchases in the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . 
 
 Environmental and Regulatory Matters 
 
 Automotive Emissions Control We are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions, including vehicle exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic (OBD) system requirements. Advanced OBD systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems. Problems detected by the OBD system and in-use compliance monitoring may increase warranty costs and the likelihood of recall. Emission and OBD requirements become more stringent each year as vehicles must meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required throughout the world with very little harmonization of global regulations. Zero emission vehicle (ZEV) requirements have been adopted by some U.S. states as well as the Canadian Province of Quebec and there is the possibility that additional jurisdictions could adopt ZEV requirements in the future. While we believe all our products are designed and manufactured in material compliance with substantially all vehicle emissions requirements, regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of the emissions compliance of products from all manufacturers. This includes vehicle emissions testing, including CO 2 and nitrogen oxide emissions testing, and review of emission control strategies. 
 
 The U.S. federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S. and various state governments impose additional requirements. Canada s federal government vehicle emission requirements are generally aligned with the U.S. federal requirements. Each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicles will meet emission requirements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada and from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) before we can sell vehicles in California and other states that have adopted the California emissions requirements. 
 
 CARB's latest emission requirements include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards including an increase in ZEVs which must be offered for sale in California. CARB has adopted 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of ZEVs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the state's long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals. The EPA has adopted similar exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards which phase in with the 2017 model year, but do not include ZEV requirements. These new requirements will also increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. 
 
 The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the California car and light-duty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements. Thirteen states currently have these standards in effect and 10 of these 13 states have adopted the ZEV requirements. 
 
 Emissions in the European Union are regulated by the European Commission (EC) and by governmental authorities in each European Union Member State (EU Member States). The EC imposes emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 28 EU Member States. We must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements from an approval authority in one EU Member State before we can sell vehicles in any EU Member State. The regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer in-use surveillance program. The European Union requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation to the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. 
 
 The existing level of European Union exhaust emission standards for cars and light-duty trucks, Euro 6, was effective in 2014 for new vehicle approvals and 2015 for new vehicle registrations. Future emission standards focus particularly on further reducing emissions from diesel vehicles by introducing new testing criteria based on real world driving emissions (RDE). RDE tests will become effective in 2017. Gasoline engines are also affected by the new requirements. The potential implementation of technology into gasoline vehicles to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions may further increase the cost of gasoline engines and could have adverse effects on vehicle fuel economy. 
 
 In addition, increased scrutiny of compliance with emissions standards may result in changes to these standards, including the implementation of RDE tests, as well as stricter interpretations or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement. This may lead to increased costs, penalties, lack of certainty with respect to product portfolio planning, negative publicity or reputation impact for us. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks.

In the long-term, we expect that the EC will continue devising regulatory requirements on the emission test cycle, RDE, low temperature testing, fuel evaporation and OBD. 
 
 China has implemented European type China 4 standards nationally with European OBD requirements for new vehicle registrations. China implemented the China 5 standards for light duty gasoline nationwide at the beginning of 2017. The China 5 standards include more stringent emission requirements and increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. China officially released a unique China 6 emission standard with the potential to combine elements of both European and U.S. standards. Our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal CAFE program through the 2017 model year. In addition to federal CAFE reporting, the EPA requires compliance with greenhouse gas requirements that are similar to the CAFE program. Our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal greenhouse gas program through the 2017 model year. CARB has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the California program for the 2012 through 2017 model years. Although Canada has no parallel CAFE-style fuel economy regulations there are Canadian greenhouse gas regulations that are aligned with the U.S. EPA regulations and Canadian fleets are expected to be compliant with these regulations through the 2017 model year. We regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and greenhouse gas regulations. 
 
 Unlike other jurisdictions, the European Union's climate change policy framework focuses on fleet average CO 2 emissions rather than fuel economy. The European Union has implemented legislation regulating fleet average CO 2 emissions in Europe and has adopted an even more stringent fleet average CO 2 target for 2020. Requirements must be met through the introduction of CO 2 reducing technologies on conventional gasoline and diesel engines or through ultra-low CO 2 vehicles. We are developing a compliance plan by adopting operational CO 2 targets for each market entry in Europe. The EC will also devise regulatory requirements on the CO 2 emission test cycle as of 2017. 
 
 China has both an individual vehicle pass-fail type approval requirement based on Phase 3 standards and a fleet fuel consumption requirement based on Phase 4 standards effective in 2016. Participating companies that fail to meet the required criteria are subject to clawback provisions and specific fines. 
 
 Industrial Environmental Control Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. 
 
 To mitigate the effects our worldwide operations have on the environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste disposal, we are committed to converting as many of our worldwide operations as possible to landfill-free operations. At December 31, 2016 , 100 (or approximately 60 of our manufacturing operations were landfill-free. At our landfill-free manufacturing operations approximately 90 of waste materials are reused or recycled and approximately 10 are converted to energy at waste-to-energy facilities. Including construction, demolition and remediation wastes, we estimate that we reused, recycled or composted over 2.5 million metric tons of waste materials at our global manufacturing operations, converted over 137,000 metric tons of waste materials to energy at waste-to-energy facilities and avoided approximately 9 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in the year ended December 31, 2016 . 
 
 In addition to minimizing our impact on the environment our landfill-free program and total waste reduction commitments generate revenue from the sale of production by-products, reduce our use of material, reduce our carbon footprint and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal. 
 
 We continue to search for ways to increase our use of renewable energy and improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and scale of renewables. Two of the sites achieved the goal for the first time, bringing the total number of GM-owned sites to have met the EPA Challenge to 75, with many sites achieving the goal multiple times. These efforts minimize our utility expenses and are part of our approach to addressing climate change through setting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, collecting accurate data, following our business plan and publicly reporting progress against our target. 
 
 Chemical Regulations We continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks.

 Chemical Regulations We continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry. Our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign regulations and expose us to a variety of domestic and foreign political, economic and other risks, including: changes in foreign or domestic government leadership; changes in foreign or domestic laws or regulations impacting our overall business model or restricting our ability to manufacture, purchase or sell products, and political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices and source raw materials, components, systems and parts on competitive terms in a manner consistent with our current practice; changes in domestic or foreign tax laws; economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade and investment policies, including restrictions on the repatriation of dividends, especially between the U.S. and China, more detailed inspections, new or higher tariffs, for example, on products imported from Mexico into the U.S.; new barriers to entry or domestic preference procurement requirements, or changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements; changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; economic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations, such as China; significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate with the effect of competition from new market entrants and in the United Kingdom (U.K.) with passage of a referendum to discontinue membership in the European Union; differing local product preferences and product requirements, including fuel economy, vehicle emissions and safety; impact of compliance with U.S. and other foreign countries export controls and economic sanctions; liabilities resulting from U.S. To the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture, we may have to take responsive or other action or we may be subject to penalties, fines or other related actions for these activities. 
 
 We are subject to extensive laws, governmental regulations and policies, including those regarding fuel economy and emissions controls, that can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business. We are significantly affected by governmental 
 
 12 

Table of Contents 
 GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 

regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio. Meeting or exceeding many of these regulations is costly and often technologically challenging, especially where standards may not be harmonized across jurisdictions, a significant challenge with respect to mandated emissions and fuel economy standards. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future. In addition, an evolving but un-harmonized regulatory framework may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect revenue. Refer to the ""Environmental and Regulatory Matters"" section of Item 1. Business for further information on these regulatory requirements. We also expect that manufacturers will continue to be subject to increased scrutiny from regulators globally. For example, in Germany, the Ministry of Transportation and the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt have requested the participation of a number of automotive manufacturers, including our German subsidiary, in continuing discussions on emissions control issues and have also requested, from time to time, written responses from our subsidiary on the subject. Our German subsidiary has participated in these discussions and has provided the requested responses to inquiries concerning nitrogen oxide emission control systems of its diesel engines. In addition, the German and the EU Parliaments have instigated Inquiry Commissions into government agencies' oversight of emissions enforcement, requesting our German subsidiary's participation. At the same time, the German government has initiated further industry-wide inquiries about CO 2 emissions. This scrutiny, regulatory changes or novel interpretations of current regulations, as well as increased enforcement has led to and may result in further increased testing and re-testing of our vehicles and analysis of their emissions control systems, which could lead to increased costs, penalties, negative publicity or reputational impact, and recall activity if regulators determine that emission levels and required regulatory compliance should be based on either a wider spectrum of driving conditions for future testing parameters or stricter or novel interpretations and consequent enforcement of existing requirements. No assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of any potential investigations or increased testing resulting from this scrutiny would not materially and adversely affect us. 
 
 We expect that to comply with fuel economy and emission control requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of hybrid electric vehicles, as well as develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all at increased cost levels. There is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs. Alternative compliance measures may not be sufficiently available in the marketplace to meet volume driven compliance requirements. 
 
 In the current uncertain regulatory framework, environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial. Alleged violations of safety or emissions standards could result in legal proceedings, the recall of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, fines, restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items. Any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.","['We had talked about 7% year-over-year.

 Takata Matters On May 4, 2016 NHTSA issued an amended consent order requiring Takata to file defect information reports (DIRs) for previously unrecalled front airbag inflators that contain phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate-based propellant without a moisture absorbing desiccant on a multi-year, risk-based schedule through 2019 impacting tens of millions of vehicles produced by numerous automotive manufacturers. NHTSA concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflators is a function of time, temperature cycling and environmental moisture. 
 
 On May 16, 2016 Takata issued its first DIR in connection with the amended consent order, and on January 3, 2017, Takata issued its second set of DIRs. For example, the airbag inflators used in the vehicles are a variant engineered specifically for our vehicles, and include features such as greater venting, unique propellant wafer configurations, and machined steel end caps. The inflators are packaged in the instrument panel in such a way as to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system. Also, these vehicles have features that minimize the

GM Financial Summary and Outlook GM Financial has expanded its leasing, near prime and prime lending programs in North America; therefore, leasing and prime lending have become a larger percentage of originations and the retail portfolio balance. Based on recent pricing trends for used vehicles in the secondary market that have remained more favorable than previously expected and the temporary impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, we now expect used car prices to decline less than 7 during 2017 compared to 2016. We continue to expect the increased supply of used vehicles to pressure used car prices in 2018. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any events or financial results, and our actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, both positive and negative. These factors, which may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on SEC Forms 10-Q and 8-K, include among others the following: (1) our ability to deliver new products, services and customer experiences in response to new participants in the automotive industry and to effectively compete in autonomous, ride sharing and transportation as a service; (2) our ability to fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (3) the success of our full-size pick-up trucks and SUVs, which may be affected by increases in the price of oil; (4) global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile; (5) aggressive competition in China; (6) the international scale and footprint of our operations which exposes us to a variety of domestic and foreign political, economic and regulatory risks, including the risk of changes in existing, the adoption of new, or the introduction of novel interpretations of, laws, regulations, policies or other activities of governments, agencies and similar organizations particularly laws, regulations and policies relating to free trade agreements, vehicle safety including recalls, and, including such actions that may affect the production, licensing, distribution or sale of our products, the cost thereof or applicable tax rates; (7) our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (8) our ability to comply with extensive laws and regulations applicable to our industry, including those regarding fuel economy and emissions; (9) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations including the potential imposition of damages, substantial fines, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us in connection with various legal proceedings and investigations relating to our various recalls; (10) our ability to comply with the terms of the DPA; (11) our ability to maintain quality control over our vehicles and avoid material vehicle recalls and the cost and effect on our reputation and products; (12) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow us to meet production schedules; (13) our dependence on our manufacturing facilities around the world; (14) our highly competitive industry, which is characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use of incentives and the introduction of new and improved vehicle models by our competitors; (15) our ability to realize production efficiencies and to achieve reductions in costs as we implement operating effectiveness initiatives throughout our automotive operations; (16) our ability to successfully restructure our operations in various countries; (17) our ability to manage risks related to security breaches and other disruptions to our vehicles, information technology networks and systems; (18) our continued ability to develop captive financing capability through GM Financial; (19) significant increases in our pension expense or projected pension contributions resulting from changes in the value of plan assets, the discount rate applied to value the pension liabilities or mortality or other assumption changes; (20) significant changes in economic, political, regulatory environment, market conditions, foreign currency exchange rates or political stability in the countries in which we operate, particularly China, with the effect of competition from new market entrants; and (21) risks and uncertainties associated with the consummation of the sale of GM Financial's European subsidiaries and branches to PSA Group, including satisfaction of the closing conditions. A further list and description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our 2016 Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC.",,"['We had talked about 7% year-over-year. I think with the recovery that we had seen already starting lower, year-over-year decline in the latter part of the second quarter and the third quarter, somewhat impacted by hurricane issues, that we see less than 7% at this point in time for the year but still a headwind. And when you think about the timing of the depreciation and everything else, most of that is going to impact Q4 from that perspective.', ""That's fair. And then in the quarter, did you see a benefit to your residual values as a result of the hurricane?

"In addition, our gross margin improvement was driven by raw material prices rising throughout the quarter resulting in an inventory holding gain.
Overall raw material costs decreased 57 percent primarily as a result of decreases in benzene and propylene costs from the second quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009. Our aromatics
segment shares certain maintenance, utilities, environmental and service costs, as well as selling, general and administrative costs with our chlorovinyls segment. For the three months ended
June 30, 2009 and 2008 there was 1.4 million and 2.0 million, respectively, of these shared costs allocated to our aromatics segment. Overall raw material costs decreased 61 percent primarily as a result of decreases in benzene and propylene costs from the first six months of 2008 to the first six months of

It is important to keep in mind that we did experience two Gulf hurricanes in the third quarter of 2008. While the ECU value is well off the level we saw in the same quarter last year, we have seen stronger pricing in both caustic and chlorine in the last several months.\nOur two building product segments, window, door profiles and moldings and outdoor building products combined produced adjusted EBITDA of $28.6 million compared to $17.3 million in the third quarter of 2008 despite sales volume declines in high teens.', 'Sales were impacted by difficult housing and construction-related market conditions, lower ECU values and higher sales volumes. Sales volumes were higher due to the two hurricanes that negatively affected sales volumes in the third quarter of 2008. This segment posted operating income of $30.6 million compared to operating income of $28 million during the same quarter in the prior year.\nIn the window and door profiles and moldings segment, sales were $98.6 million for the third quarter of 2009 compared to $124 million during the same quarter in the prior year.', 'Compared sequentially, controllable working capital increased by $5 million. This year we made the decision to carry more inventories through the hurricane season, which offset the $30 million sequential improvement in accounts payable.\nTurning to income taxes, in the third quarter we had a tax provision of $178.5 million and an effective tax rate of 43.7%, both driven by the gain from the debt exchange. For the full year 2009, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the 35% to 45% range.\nAs many of you know, one of the keys to our successful debt exchange was a provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that stipulates that the Federal tax generated by the gain on the debt exchange may be deferred for five years, and beginning in 2014, paid over five years, which will be about $15 million per year based on preliminary tax gain calculation for the debt exchange.\nIn addition to the deferred tax related to the debt exchange, most of the tax expense you see on the income statement will not result in cash tax payments in 2009, rather we will reduce certain tax assets, such as net operating loss carry-forwards and foreign tax credits.']",negative,only_Mgm,treatment,75222,9.0,8.0,0.058823526,negative,0.930660605,6.0,7.0,2.0,451.0,0.0133037694013303,0.0155210643015521,0.0044345898004434
"In addition, in
September, we amended our revolving credit agreement. The amendment allows for
a reduction in the minimum interest coverage ratio, our most restrictive
covenant, providing additional flexibility to weather these difficult financial
times. However, the amendment also permanently decreased our capacity under the
credit agreement, which expires in 2011, to 800 million, from 850 million. If
such declines continue throughout our industry, we may not have sufficient
liquidity under our current credit facility to execute our business plan. We
may be required to further modify the facility and assess the viability of
other methods of raising equity and/or debt capital to provide us with adequate
liquidity to weather the current market decline and emerge with enough
resources to take advantage of opportunities when the market turn around begins.
There can be no assurances, however, that if needed, we will be able to obtain
such modifications or raise such capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

"During the fourth quarter of 2007, we paid down a substantial amount of
the debt under our Credit Facility from cash generated by operations, reducing
the outstanding balance from 234.5 million at September 30, 2007 to 82.0
million at December 31, 2007. 

Despite
current market conditions, we believe we are positioned to weather the current homebuilding
industry downturn, and to take advantage of opportunities as the market improves.
Continuing population growth in our key regions, our supply of inventory of
entitled land in desirable locations, and regulations that constrain the
development of raw land in many of these key markets, favor our geographic
position. Coupled with this strong
inventory position, we believe that our product diversification, respected brands,
solid balance sheet and management experience position us for future growth
when the homebuilding market stabilizes. Certain of these policies involve significant judgments,
assumptions and estimates by management that may have a material impact on the
carrying value of certain assets and liabilities, and revenue and costs. We are
subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events, economic,
environmental and political factors and changes in our business environment;
therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, the
accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will
change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional
information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. 

We amended our Credit
Facility in September 2007. This
amendment provided covenant relief under our interest coverage ratio, our most
restrictive covenant, creating additional flexibility to weather these
difficult financial times. However, the
amendment also permanently decreased our capacity under the Credit Facility,
which expires in 2011, to 800 million, from 850 million.","As a result of such variability,
our historical performance may not be a meaningful indicator of future
results. Factors that contribute to this
variability include: 

timing of home deliveries
and land sales; 

delays in construction
schedules due to strikes, adverse weather, acts of God, reduced subcontractor
availability and governmental restrictions; 

our ability to acquire additional
land or options for additional land on acceptable terms; 

conditions of the real
estate market in areas where we operate and of the general economy; 

the cyclical nature of the
homebuilding industry, changes in prevailing interest rates and the availability
of mortgage financing; and 

costs and availability of
materials and labor. 

Our substantial level of indebtedness may adversely
affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our debt
obligations. We are subject
to various fees and charges of government authorities designed to defray the
cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements. We may be subject to additional costs and
delays or may be precluded entirely from building projects because of no-growth 
or slow-growth initiatives, building permit ordinances, building moratoriums,
or similar government regulations that could be imposed in the future due to
health, safety, welfare or environmental concerns. We must also obtain licenses, permits and
approvals from government agencies to engage in certain activities, the
granting or receipt of which are beyond our control and could cause delays in
our homebuilding projects. 

We are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal
statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of
health and the environment. 
Environmental laws or permit restrictions may result in project delays,
may cause substantial compliance and other costs and may prohibit or severely
restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or geographic
areas. Environmental regulations can
also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw
materials, such as lumber. 

Acts of war may seriously harm our business. 

We have homebuilding operations in Texas, California and
Florida. Some of our markets in Texas
and Florida occasionally experience extreme weather conditions such as
tornadoes and/or hurricanes. California
has experienced a significant number of earthquakes, wildfires, flooding,
landslides and other natural disasters in recent years. We do not insure against some of these
risks.","[""We're also adjusting our plans based on conservative assumptions for 2009.\nOur third quarter 2008 home closing revenue declined 35% from the prior year as a result of 25% lower closings and a 14% decline in average sales prices.

"In response to these
conditions, we are focusing on the following initiatives: (1) consolidating
overhead functions at our divisions to reduce our general and administrative
cost burden, (2) reducing our total lot supply by renegotiating or opting
out of lot purchase and option contracts, (3) reducing unsold home
inventory and significantly limiting construction of speculative homes, (4) exercising
tight control over cash flows, particularly as related to spec home starts and
land development spending for long-range projects, (5) increasing sales
and marketing efforts to generate additional traffic, (6) renegotiating
construction costs with our subcontractors where possible and (7) monitoring
our customer satisfaction scores and making improvements based on the results

addition, the homebuilding industry does not produce a product which is subject

its normal profit levels as the temporary factors which are now negatively
impacting the industry such as credit availability and excess supply are
gradually resolved. Furthermore, we
believe that we have sufficient financial resources to weather the normal long
homebuilding business cycle and return to normal profitability levels when the

Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the political, cultural and economic climate outside the United States will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Operations at our European production facilities are traditionally subject to shutdowns for approximately one month during the third quarter of each year for employee vacations. Because of the seasonal fluctuations, comparisons of our operating results for the third quarter of any fiscal year with those of the other quarters during the same fiscal year may be of limited relevance in predicting our future financial performance. 
 
 Environmental matters 
 
 Environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable. The amount of liability recorded is based on currently available information, including the progress of remedial investigations, current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation, presently enacted laws and existing technology. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental obligations are not discounted to their present value. We do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued. Future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including, but not limited to, the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation, the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the availability and application of technology. We do not expect the resolution of such uncertainties to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. At October 1, 2011, the environmental reserve, which is predominately euro-denominated, was 13.9 million. 
 
 In connection with the acquisition of Membrana GmbH Membrana in 2002, we recorded a reserve for environmental obligations. The reserve provides for costs to remediate known environmental issues and operational upgrades which are required in order for us to remain in compliance with local regulations. The initial estimate and subsequent finalization of the reserve was included in the allocation of purchase price at the date of acquisition. At October 1, 2011, the environmental reserve for the Membrana facility was 13.6 million. We anticipate that expenditures will be made over the next three to five years. 
 
 We have indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from Acordis A.G. Acordis and Akzo Nobel N.V. Akzo ), the prior owners of Membrana. Akzo originally provided broad environmental protections to Acordis with the right to assign such indemnities to Acordis s successors. Akzo s indemnifications relate to conditions existing prior to December 1999, which is the date that Membrana was sold to Acordis.","Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we do not know whether our expectations will prove correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including with respect to Polypore International, the following, among other things: 
 
 the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we sell our products; 
 the failure to continue to develop innovative products; 
 the loss of our customers; 
 the vertical integration by our customers of the production of our products into their own manufacturing process; 
 increases in prices for raw materials or the loss of key supplier contracts;

There can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities within such governments countries. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the political, cultural and economic climate outside the United States will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Operations at our European production facilities are traditionally subject to shutdowns for approximately one month during the third quarter of each year for employee vacations. Because of the seasonal fluctuations, comparisons of our operating results for the third quarter of any fiscal year with those of the other quarters during the same fiscal year may be of limited relevance in predicting our future financial performance. 
 
 Environmental matters 
 
 Environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable. The amount of liability recorded is based on currently available information, including the progress of remedial investigations, current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation, presently enacted laws and existing technology. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental obligations are not discounted to their present value. We do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued. Future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including, but not limited to, the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation, the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the availability and application of technology. We do not expect the resolution of such uncertainties to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. At October 1, 2011, the environmental reserve, which is predominately euro-denominated, was 13.9 million. 
 
 In connection with the acquisition of Membrana GmbH Membrana in 2002, we recorded a reserve for environmental obligations. The reserve provides for costs to remediate known environmental issues and operational upgrades which are required in order for us to remain in compliance with local regulations. The initial estimate and subsequent finalization of the reserve was included in the allocation of purchase price at the date of acquisition. At October 1, 2011, the environmental reserve for the Membrana facility was 13.6 million. We anticipate that expenditures will be made over the next three to five years. 
 
 We have indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from Acordis A.G. Acordis and Akzo Nobel N.V. Akzo ), the prior owners of Membrana.

Environmental matters 

 Environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable. The amount of liability recorded is
based on currently available information, including the progress of remedial investigations, current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation,
presently enacted laws and existing technology. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. We do not currently
anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued. Future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including, but not limited to, the difficulty in estimating the

environmental issues and operational upgrades which are required in order for us to remain in compliance with local regulations. The initial estimate and subsequent finalization of the reserve was
included in the
allocation of purchase price at the date of acquisition. At December 31, 2011, the environmental reserve for the Membrana facility, which is denominated in euros, was 12.0 million. We
anticipate that the majority of expenditures associated with the reserve will be made in the next twelve months. 

 We
have indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from Acordis A.G. (""Acordis"") and Akzo Nobel N.V. (""Akzo""), the prior owners of Membrana. Akzo originally
provided broad environmental protections to Acordis with the right to assign such indemnities to Acordis's successors. Akzo's indemnifications relate to conditions existing prior to December 1999,
which is the date that Membrana was sold to Acordis. By segment, electronics and EDVs increased 70.0 million, transportation and industrial increased 57.2 million and separations
media increased 19.3 million. As described more fully in the discussion of segment operating results, net sales in the first quarter of 2012 will be negatively impacted by the following:
electronics and EDVs weakness in
consumer electronics and the production schedule of two EDV models; transportation and industrial delay in lead-acid replacement battery sales due to mild weather conditions in
North America and Europe; and separations media order timing in healthcare. 

 Gross profit. We believe that the short-term impact in the second half of 2011 on sales in China from the government mandate requiring lead-acid battery
producers to demonstrate the proper handling of lead has improved. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we started to see the impact of mild winter weather in North America and Europe, which will
temporarily impact replacement battery sales in the first quarter of 2012 if it continues. 

 Segment operating income. There can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take
other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities within such governments' countries. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the political,
cultural and economic climate outside the United States will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy. 

 Seasonality 

 Operations at our European production facilities are traditionally subject to shutdowns for approximately one month during the third
quarter of each year for employee vacations. There can be no assurance that any additional
financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

of the payments, if any, are not known.
 (6) As
discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in ""Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" we have a net
environmental receivable of 0.1 million, consisting of an environmental obligation of 12.0 million offset by the related indemnification receivable of 12.1 million.
Indemnification payments are received after expenditures are made against approved claims. As a result, we expect to make environmental obligation payments over the next twelve months and receive
indemnification payments over the next two years.

connection with the acquisition of Membrana GmbH (""Membrana"") in 2002, the Company recorded a reserve for environmental obligations. The reserve provides for costs to remediate
known environmental issues and operational upgrades which are required in order for the Company to remain in compliance with local regulations. The initial estimate and subsequent finalization of the
reserve was included in the allocation of purchase price at the date of acquisition. The environmental reserve for the Membrana facility, which is denominated in euros, was 11,957,000 and 15,202,000
at December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011, respectively. The Company anticipates that the majority of expenditures associated with the reserve will be made in the next twelve months. The
current portion of the reserve is classified in ""Accrued liabilities"" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

The
Company has indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from Acordis A.G. (""Acordis"") and Akzo Nobel N.V. (""Akzo""), the prior owners of Membrana. Akzo
originally provided broad environmental protections to Acordis with the right to assign such indemnities to Acordis's successors. Akzo's indemnifications relate to conditions existing prior to
December 1999, which is the date that Membrana was sold to Acordis. The Company recognized a gain of 3,327,000 on the sale, net of direct transaction costs. As a result of the stock sale, the buyer acquired all of the assets and liabilities of
Daramic S.r.l., including the Potenza, Italy facility, which was closed in 2008, and environmental and restructuring obligations associated with the Potenza site. In addition to assuming all
assets and liabilities, the buyer fully indemnified the Company with regard to all environmental, health and safety matters related to this site. In connection with the sale,
the Company was required to make net cash payments to the buyer of 16,047,000, consisting of the settlement of an acquired intercompany receivable due to Daramic S.r.l.","Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our
forward-looking statements are reasonable, we do not know whether our expectations will prove correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and
uncertainties, including with respect to Polypore International, the following, among other things: 

the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we sell our products; 
 the failure to continue to develop innovative products; 
 the loss of our customers; 
 the vertical integration by our customers of the production of our products into their own manufacturing process; 
 increases in prices for raw materials or the loss of key supplier contracts; 
 our substantial indebtedness; 
 interest rate risk related to our variable rate indebtedness; 
 our inability to generate cash; 
 restrictions related to the senior secured credit agreement; 
 employee slowdowns, strikes or similar actions; 
 product liability claims exposure; 
 risks in connection with our operations outside the United States, including compliance with applicable
anti-corruption laws; 
 the incurrence of substantial costs to comply with, or as a result of violations of, or liabilities under environmental
laws; 
 the failure to protect our intellectual property; 
 the loss of senior management;

Because
our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements, we cannot give any assurance that
any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will occur or, if any of them do, what impact they will have on Polypore International's results of operations and financial condition.

Environmental matters 

 We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations which govern, among other
things, air emissions, wastewater discharges and the handling, storage disposal and release of wastes and hazardous substances. It is our policy to comply with applicable environmental requirements at
all of our facilities. We are also subject to laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (""CERCLA""), that may impose liability retroactively and without
fault for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at on-site or off-site locations. From time to time, we have identified environmental compliance issues at our
facilities. 

 We
have conducted some cleanup of on-site releases at some facilities and we will be conducting additional cleanups of on-site contamination at other facilities
under regulatory supervision or voluntarily. Costs for such work and related measures (such as eliminating sources of contamination) could be substantial, particularly at our Wuppertal, Germany
facility. We have established reserves for

 environmental
liabilities at our Wuppertal, Germany facility of 12.0 million as of December 31, 2011. We do not anticipate that the remediation activities will disrupt operations at our
facilities or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. To date we have not had any significant disagreement with Akzo Nobel N.V. over its environmental indemnity obligations to us. 

 Intellectual property rights 

 We consider our patents and trademarks, in the aggregate, to be important to our business and seek to protect our tradenames,
trademarks, brandnames, proprietary technology and know-how in part through United States and foreign patents and trademark registrations and applications. As a component of heart-lung machines, blood oxygenators

 environmental
liabilities at our Wuppertal, Germany facility of 12.0 million as of December 31, 2011. We do not anticipate that the remediation activities will disrupt operations at our
facilities or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. To date we have not had any significant disagreement with Akzo Nobel N.V. over its environmental indemnity obligations to us. 

 Intellectual property rights 

 We consider our patents and trademarks, in the aggregate, to be important to our business and seek to protect our tradenames,
trademarks, brandnames, proprietary technology and know-how in part through United States and foreign patents and trademark registrations and applications. Our continued overseas expansion, especially in the aforementioned emerging markets, naturally increases the risk of such violations and
consequently could cause a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. 

 We could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental laws, and violations of such laws may increase our costs or require us to change certain business practices. 

 We use and generate a variety of chemicals and other hazardous by-products in our manufacturing operations. As a result, we
are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These environmental laws govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges and the
handling, storage and release of wastes and hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations can be complex and change often. We regularly incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, and
such costs could increase significantly with changes in legal requirements or their interpretation or enforcement. Some of our manufacturing facilities have been the subject of actions to enforce
environmental requirements. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions and third-party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of
violations of environmental laws. Failure to comply with environmental requirements could also result in enforcement actions that materially limit or otherwise affect the operations of the facilities
involved. 

 Under
certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of an environmentally contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of investigation, removal or
remediation of hazardous materials at such property. This liability could result whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of any hazardous materials. Investigations and/or clean-ups of these contaminants
have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites. The costs of investigating and remediating environmental conditions 

 19 

Table of Contents 

 at
some of our facilities may be substantial. Although we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification for a portion of these costs, if we do not receive expected indemnification payments,
or if our remediation costs are higher than expected, our exposure to these costs would increase. If the appellate court affirms the FTC's decision, and we choose not
to seek Supreme Court review or the Supreme Court denies our petition seeking review of the case, then we will be required to divest substantially all of the assets acquired in the Microporous
acquisition, and we will be subject to some prospective restrictions on our future conduct. 

 Our operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural disasters, epidemics, terrorist acts and other events beyond our control, which could adversely affect
our business. 

 Our operations may be subject to significant interruption if any of our facilities are damaged or destroyed. For example, certain of
our products are manufactured at a single facility location for which we do not maintain a backup manufacturing facility. A natural or other disaster, such as a fire or flood, could significantly
disrupt our operations, delay or prevent product manufacture and shipment for the time required to repair, rebuild or replace our manufacturing facilities, which could be lengthy, and result in large
expenses to repair or replace the facilities. In addition, concerns about terrorism or an outbreak of epidemic diseases, especially in our major markets of North America, Europe and Asia could have a
negative effect on travel and our business operations, and result in adverse consequences on our sales and financial performance. There can be no assurance that any additional
financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. 

 Environmental matters 

 Environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable. The amount of liability recorded is
based on currently available information, including the progress of remedial investigations, current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation,
presently enacted laws and existing technology. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future
expenditures for environmental obligations are not discounted to their present value. We do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued. Future remediation expenses may
be affected by a number of uncertainties including, but not limited to, the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation, the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the
availability and application of technology. We do not expect the resolution of such uncertainties to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity. Recoveries of
environmental costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. 

 In
connection with the acquisition of Membrana in 2002, we recorded a reserve for environmental obligations. The reserve provides for costs to remediate known environmental issues and
operational upgrades which are required in order for us to remain in compliance with local regulations. The initial estimate and subsequent finalization of the reserve was included in the allocation
of purchase price at the date of acquisition. The environmental reserve for the Membrana facility, which is denominated in euros, was 12.0 million at December 31, 2011. We anticipate
that that majority of expenditures associated with the reserve will be made in the next twelve months. 

 We
have indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from Acordis and Akzo, the prior owners of Membrana. Akzo originally provided broad environmental protections to
Acordis with the right to assign such indemnities to Acordis's successors. Akzo's indemnifications relate to conditions existing prior to December 1999, which is the date that Membrana was sold to
Acordis. Payments related to this liability are not included in the table above since the timing and actual amounts
of the payments, if any, are not known.
 (6) As
discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in ""Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" we have a net
environmental receivable of 0.1 million, consisting of an environmental obligation of 12.0 million offset by the related indemnification receivable of 12.1 million.
Indemnification payments are received after expenditures are made against approved claims. As a result, we expect to make environmental obligation payments over the next twelve months and receive
indemnification payments over the next two years.

of remedial investigations, current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation, presently enacted laws and existing technology. Accruals
for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental obligations are not discounted
to their present value. The Company does not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued. However, the Company's future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of
uncertainties including, but not limited to, the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation, the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the availability and application of
technology. The Company does not expect the resolution of such uncertainties to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Recoveries of environmental costs
from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. 

In
connection with the acquisition of Membrana GmbH (""Membrana"") in 2002, the Company recorded a reserve for environmental obligations. The reserve provides for costs to remediate
known environmental issues and operational upgrades which are required in order for the Company to remain in compliance with local regulations. The initial estimate and subsequent finalization of the
reserve was included in the allocation of purchase price at the date of acquisition. The environmental reserve for the Membrana facility, which is denominated in euros, was 11,957,000 and 15,202,000
at December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011, respectively. The Company anticipates that the majority of expenditures associated with the reserve will be made in the next twelve months. The
current portion of the reserve is classified in ""Accrued liabilities"" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

The
Company has indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from Acordis A.G. (""Acordis"") and Akzo Nobel N.V. (""Akzo""), the prior owners of Membrana. Akzo
originally provided broad environmental protections to Acordis with the right to assign such indemnities to Acordis's successors. Akzo's indemnifications relate to conditions existing prior to
December 1999, which is the date that Membrana was sold to Acordis. The Company recognized a gain of 3,327,000 on the sale, net of direct transaction costs. As a result of the stock sale, the buyer acquired all of the assets and liabilities of
Daramic S.r.l., including the Potenza, Italy facility, which was closed in 2008, and environmental and restructuring obligations associated with the Potenza site. In addition to assuming all
assets and liabilities, the buyer fully indemnified the Company with regard to all environmental, health and safety matters related to this site. In connection with the sale,
the Company was required to make net cash payments to the buyer of 16,047,000, consisting of the settlement of an acquired intercompany receivable due to Daramic S.r.l.","['Thanks, Kathy.

"Overview 
 Ameresco is a leading provider of energy efficiency solutions for facilities throughout North America and Europe. We provide solutions that enable customers to reduce their energy consumption, lower their operating and maintenance costs and realize environmental benefits. Our comprehensive set of services includes upgrades to a facility s energy infrastructure and the construction and operation of small-scale renewable energy plants. 
 Under our contracts, we typically do not take responsibility for a wide variety of factors outside of our control and exclude or adjust for such factors in commitment calculations. These factors include variations in energy prices and utility rates, weather, facility occupancy schedules, the amount of energy-using equipment in a facility and the failure of the customer to operate or maintain the project properly. Typically, our performance commitments apply to the aggregate overall performance of a project rather than to individual energy efficiency measures. The amount of such financing is included on our consolidated balance sheet. 
 Effects of Seasonality 
 We are subject to seasonal fluctuations and construction cycles, particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months, such as the northern United States and Canada, or at educational institutions, where large projects are typically carried out during summer months when their facilities are unoccupied. In addition, government customers, many of which have fiscal years that do not coincide with ours, typically follow annual procurement cycles and appropriate funds on a fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year.","We depend in part on legislation and government policies that support energy efficiency and renewable energy projects that enhance the economic feasibility of our energy efficiency services and small-scale renewable energy projects. This support includes legislation and regulations that authorize and regulate the manner in which certain governmental entities do business with us; encourage or subsidize governmental procurement of our services; encourage or in some cases require other customers to procure power from renewable or low-emission sources, to reduce their electricity use or otherwise to procure our services; and provide us with tax and other incentives that reduce our costs or increase our revenues. Without this support, on which projects frequently rely for economic feasibility, our ability to complete projects for existing customers and obtain project commitments from new customers could be adversely affected. In addition, we will often choose to bear the costs of such efforts prior to obtaining project financing, prior to getting final regulatory approval and prior to our final sale to a customer, if any. 
 Successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including: failures or delays in obtaining desired or necessary land rights, including ownership, leases and/or easements; failures or delays in obtaining necessary permits, licenses or other governmental support or approvals, or in overcoming objections from members of the public or adjoining land owners; uncertainties relating to land costs for projects; unforeseen engineering problems; access to available transmission for electricity generated by our small-scale renewable energy plants; construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls; work stoppages or labor disruptions and compliance with labor regulations; cost over-runs; availability of products and components from suppliers; adverse weather conditions; environmental, archaeological and geological conditions; and availability of construction and permanent financing. 
 If we are unable to complete the development of a small-scale renewable energy plants or fail to meet one or more agreed target construction milestone dates, we may be subject to liquidated damages and/or penalties under the Engineering Procurement and Construction agreement or other agreements relating to the power plant or project, and we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project. 
 Our business is affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles, and these trends and cycles could have an adverse effect on our operating results. 
 We are subject to seasonal fluctuations and construction cycles, particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months, such as the northern United States and Canada, or at educational institutions, where large projects are typically carried out during summer months when their facilities are unoccupied.

Under our contracts, we typically do not take responsibility for a wide variety of factors outside our control and exclude or adjust for such factors in commitment calculations. These factors include variations in energy prices and utility rates, weather, facility occupancy schedules, the amount of energy-using equipment in a facility, and failure of the customer to operate or maintain the project properly. We rely in part on warranties from our equipment suppliers and subcontractors to back-stop the warranties we provide to our customers and, where appropriate, pass on the warranties to our customers. 
 We may be unable to complete or operate our projects on a profitable basis or as we have committed to our customers. 
 Development, installation and construction of our energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and operation of our renewable energy projects, entails many risks, including: 
 
 failure to receive critical components and equipment that meet our design specifications and can be delivered on schedule; 
 
 failure to obtain all necessary rights to land access and use; 
 
 failure to receive quality and timely performance of third-party services; 
 
 increases in the cost of labor, equipment and commodities needed to construct or operate projects; 
 
 permitting and other regulatory issues, license revocation and changes in legal requirements; 
 
 shortages of equipment or skilled labor; 
 
 unforeseen engineering problems; 
 
 failure of a customer to accept or pay for renewable energy that we supply; 
 
 weather interferences, catastrophic events including fires, explosions, earthquakes, droughts and acts of terrorism; and accidents involving personal injury or the loss of life; 
 
 labor disputes and work stoppages; 
 
 mishandling of hazardous substances and waste; and 
 
 other events outside of our control. 
 Any of these factors could give rise to construction delays and construction and other costs in excess of our expectations. 
 Any future acquisitions that we may make could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our business, financial condition or operating results. 
 If we are successful in consummating acquisitions, those acquisitions could subject us to a number of risks, including: 
 
 the purchase price we pay could significantly deplete our cash reserves or result in dilution to our existing stockholders; 
 
 we may find that the acquired company or assets do not improve our customer offerings or market position as planned; 
 
 we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company; 
 
 key personnel and customers of the acquired company may terminate their relationships with the acquired company as a result of the acquisition; 
 
 we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning and financial reporting; 
 
 we may incur additional costs and expenses related to complying with additional laws, rules or regulations in new jurisdictions; 
 
 we may assume or be held liable for risks and liabilities (including for environmental-related costs) as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not discover during our due diligence or adequately adjust for in our acquisition arrangements; 
 
 our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises; 
 
 we may incur one-time write-offs or restructuring charges in connection with the acquisition; 
 
 we may acquire goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to amortization or impairment tests, which could result in future charges to earnings; and 
 
 we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated. 
 These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 If we become subject to additional regulation under PUHCA, FPA or other regulatory frameworks, if existing regulatory requirements become more onerous, or if other material changes to the regulation of the electric power markets take place, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. 
 Compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our operating results. 
 Costs of compliance with federal, state, provincial, local and other foreign existing and future environmental regulations could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability. We are required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations and to obtain numerous governmental permits in connection with energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and we may incur significant additional costs to comply with these requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability, damages and fines. Existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our projects, and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur. These factors may materially increase the amount we must invest to bring our projects into compliance and impose additional expense on our operations. 
 In addition, private lawsuits or enforcement actions by federal, state, provincial and/or foreign regulatory agencies may materially increase our costs. Certain environmental laws make us potentially liable on a joint and several basis for the remediation of contamination at or emanating from properties or facilities we currently or formerly owned or operated or

properties to which we arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Such liability is not limited to the cleanup of contamination we actually caused. Although we seek to obtain indemnities against liabilities relating to historical contamination at the facilities we own or operate, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur liability relating to the remediation of contamination, including contamination we did not cause. 
 We may not be able to obtain or maintain, from time to time, all required environmental regulatory approvals. A delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or failure to obtain and comply with them could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 International expansion is one of our growth strategies, and international operations will expose us to additional risks that we do not face in the United States, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. 
 We and certain of our third-party vendors receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like those of other companies, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations.","['region, some of which are behind schedule.

 Raw materials that are necessary in the production and packaging of our products are subject to fluctuations in availability, quality and price that could adversely impact our business and financial results. 
 The availability, size, quality and cost of raw materials used in the production and packaging of our products, including nuts, potatoes, corn and corn products, cooking and vegetable oils, corrugate, resins and other commodities, are subject to price volatility and supply fluctuations caused by changes in global supply and demand, weather conditions (whether caused by climate change or otherwise), natural disasters, crop disease, pests, government agricultural and energy programs, foreign currency exchange rates and consumer demand. In particular, the availability and cost of walnuts and other nuts are subject to supply contract renewals, crop size, quality, yield fluctuations, and changes in governmental regulation as well as other factors. Additionally, we rely on raw materials that come from regions that suffer from severe water scarcity or yearly fluctuations in water availability, such as California where severe drought conditions are at historical levels, and fluctuations in the availability of water may reduce the availability of raw materials not only in a particular season but also over time. 
 We source walnuts primarily from California growers with whom we have entered into walnut purchase agreements. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

There are risks specifically related to our international sales and operations that could adversely impact our business and results of operations. These include: 

foreign exchange rates, foreign currency exchange and transfer restrictions, which may unpredictably and adversely impact our consolidated operating results, our asset and liability balances and our cash flow in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency; 
 
 negative economic developments in economies around the world and the instability of governments, including the threat of war, terrorist attacks, epidemic or civil unrest; 
 
 pandemics, such as the flu, which may adversely affect our workforce as well as our local suppliers and customers; 
 
 earthquakes, tsunamis, floods or other major disasters that may limit the supply of nuts or other products that we purchase abroad; 
 
 trade barriers, including tariffs, quotas, and import or export licensing requirements imposed by governments; 
 
 increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation; 
 
 differing labor standards; 
 
 differing levels of protection of intellectual property; 
 
 difficulties and costs associated with complying with U.S. laws and regulations applicable to entities with overseas operations; 
 
 varying regulatory, tax, judicial and administrative practices in the jurisdictions where we operate; 
 
 difficulties associated with operating under a wide variety of complex foreign laws, treaties and regulations; and 
 
 potentially burdensome taxation.","[""So yes, there's basically 3 issues that are impacting freight, one of which is transitory, 2 of which are a little more enduring.

,"Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. 
 Our ability to manufacture and sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, pandemics or other events. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances where a product or ingredient is sourced from a single supplier or location. If unauthorized parties gain access to our systems, they could obtain and exploit confidential business, customer, or employee information and harm our competitive position. In addition, these information systems may experience damage, failures, interruptions, errors, inefficiencies, attacks or suffer from fires or natural disasters, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results if not adequately mitigated by our security measures and disaster recovery plans. 
 Furthermore, with multiple information technology systems as a result of acquisitions, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating data. New or increased government regulation of the food industry, including but not limited to areas related to food safety, chemical composition, production processes, traceability, product quality, packaging, labeling, school lunch guidelines, promotions, marketing and advertising (particularly such communications that are directed toward children), product recalls, records, storage and distribution could adversely impact our results of operations by increasing production costs or restricting our methods of operation and distribution. These regulations may address food industry or societal factors, such as obesity, nutritional and environmental concerns and diet trends.

,"Issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us. Our purchases of raw materials
are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. The most significant raw materials used by us in our
business are dairy products, pepper, garlic, onion, capsicums (red pepper and paprika), soybean oil and wheat. Therefore we cannot provide assurance that
future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. In addition, we may
have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield, government actions, political unrest in producing countries, changes in agricultural programs and other factors
beyond our control. Therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, or operating results. 
 We could have an interruption in our business, loss of inventory or data, be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural
disaster, catastrophic event, epidemic or computer system failure. Natural disasters could include an earthquake, fire, flood, tornado or severe storm. A catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack. An epidemic could affect our operating
activities, major facilities or employees and customers health. In addition, some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather; a major storm, heavy snowfall or other similar event
could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner. Production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site. We
cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue, and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses
that may occur from any of the foregoing. In the event that a natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time, or if harsh weather

Airlines are often affected by certain
factors beyond their control, including weather conditions which can affect
their operations. 

Generally, revenues for airlines depend
on the number of passengers carried, the fare paid by each passenger and service
factors, such as the timeliness of departure and arrival. During periods of fog,
ice, low temperatures, storms or other adverse weather conditions, flights may
be cancelled or significantly delayed. For example, in 2005, Hurricane Wilma
forced us to suspend some of our operations in Florida for a number of days. Under our fixed-fee
code-share agreements, we are partially protected against cancellations due to
weather or air traffic control, although these factors may affect our ability to
receive incentive payments for flying more than the minimum number of flights
specified in our code-share agreements. Should we enter into pro-rate revenue
sharing agreements in the future we will not be protected against weather or air
traffic control cancellations and our operating revenues could suffer as a
result. 

The airline industry has recently gone
through a period of consolidation and transition; consequently, we have fewer
potential partners.","['ItÃ¢ÂÂs clear from the developments over the last four months thereÃ¢ÂÂs been a lot of distractions, including the termination of our frontier relationship, the accelerated removal of the final 11 Delta E135 aircrafts, both of which resulted in some employee furlough here. \nAnd of course, two major hurricanes, Gustav and Ike in the quarter, and yet the people of Republic Airways never lost their focus and never wavered in their commitment in operational quality and customer service excellence.

"Operations in the deepwater can result in increased operational risks as has been demonstrated by the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. Despite technological advances since this disaster, liabilities for environmental losses, personal injury and loss of life and significant regulatory fines in the event of a disaster could be well in excess of insured amounts and result in significant current losses on our statements of operations as well as going concern issues. 
 Oil Spill Response Plan. We maintain a Regional Oil Spill Response Plan that defines our response requirements, procedures and remediation plans in the event we have an oil spill. Oil Spill Response Plans are generally approved by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement BSEE bi-annually, except when changes are required, in which case revised plans are required to be submitted for approval at the time changes are made. Additionally, these plans are tested and drills are conducted periodically at all levels.

Hurricanes. Since our operations are in the Gulf of Mexico, we are particularly vulnerable to the effects of hurricanes on production. Additionally, affordable insurance cov erage for property damage to our facilities for hurricanes has become less effecti ve due to rising retentions and limitations on named windstorm coverage and has been difficult to obtain at times in recent years. Significant hurricane impacts could include reductions and/or deferrals of future oil and natural gas production and revenues , increased lease operating expenses for evacuations and repairs and possible acceleration of plugging and abandonment costs.

Compliance with these added and more stringent regulatory requirements and with existing environmental and spill regulations, together with uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies and delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill response, and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. Moreover, these governmental agencies are continuing to evaluate aspects of safety and operational performance in the Gulf of Mexico and, as a result, are continuing to develop and implement new, more restrictive requirements. For example, in April 2016, BSEE published a final rule on well control that, among other things, imposes rigorous standards relating to the design, operation, and maintenance of blow-out preventers, real-time monitoring of deepwater and high temperature, high pressure drilling activities, and enhanced reporting requirements. Pursuant to President Trump s Executive Orders dated March 28, 2017, and April 28, 2017 (the Executive Orders ), respectively, BSEE initiated a review of the well control regulations to determine whether the rules are consistent with the stated policy of encouraging energy exploration and production, while ensuring that any such activity is safe and environmentally responsible. One consequence of this review is that on December 29, 2017, the BSEE published proposed revisions to its regulations regarding offshore drilling safety equipment, which proposal includes the removal of the requirement for offshore operators to certify through an independent third party that their critical safety and pollution prevention equipment e.g. The December 2017 proposed rule has not been finalized and there remains substantial uncertainty as to the scope and extent of any revisions to existing oil and gas safety and performance-related regulations and other regulatory initiatives that ultimately will be adopted by BSEE pursuant to its review process. 
 Also, in April 2016, BOEM published a proposed rule that would update existing air emissions requirements relating to offshore oil and natural gas activity on the OCS. BOEM regulates these air emissions in connection with its review of exploration and development plans, rights of way and rights of use, and/or easement applications. The proposed rule would bolster existing air emissions requirements by, among other things, requiring the reporting and tracking of the emissions of all pollutants defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA to affect human health and public welfare. Pursuant to the Executive Orders, BOEM has ceased rulemaking activities for and is reviewing the proposed air quality rule. Additionally, if left unchanged, the existing, or future, more stringent oil and gas safety and performance-related regulations and other regulatory initiatives imposed by the BOEM and BSEE could result in increased financial assurance requirements and incurrence of associated added costs, limit operational activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities. Also, if material spill incidents were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries where such an event may occur could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws or regulations on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover some or all of the risks associated with such operations. These and other changes to BOEM bonding and financial assurance requirements could result in increased costs on our operations and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 53 

We ha ve a subsidiary that is subject to a plea agreement with the D epartment of J ustice DOJ pursuant to which certain exploration and production activities must comply with a Safety and Environmental Compliance Program SECP ). Noncompliance with the SECP could result in a violation of the plea agreement and provide a basis for revocation or mo dification of probation. The Court placed ERT on probation for three years. The conditions of probation include compliance with an agreed SECP, pursuant to which ERT and another subsidiary of ours must implement enhanced safety and environmental compliance inspections, reviews and audits, implement a comprehensive training program, implement enhanced operational controls to better manage, detect and prevent safety and environmental violations, and preparation and implementation of schedule for decommissioning. we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the SECP, a failure to comply with the SECP could result in a violation of the plea agreement and provide a basis for revocation or modification of probation, which could adversely our financial condition and operations. A further reduction in commodity prices may result in a further decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production. 
 Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including: 

our proved reserves; 

the level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from our wells; 

the prices at which our production is sold; 

our ability to acquire, locate, and produce new reserves; and 

our ability to borrow under our Bank Credit Facility. 

 54 

If low oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, or other factors, many of which are beyond our control, ca use our revenues, cash flows from operating activities, and the borrowing base under our Bank Credit Facility to decrease, we may be limited in our ability to fund the capital necessary to complete our capital expenditure program. Unlike other entities that are geographically diversified, we may not have the resources to effectively diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. Our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive, and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have an adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we operate, and result in our dependency upon a single or limited number of hydrocarbon basins. In addition, the geographic concentration of our properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf Coast means that some or all of the properties could be affected should the region experience: 

severe weather, such as hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions; 

delays or decreases in production, the availability of equipment, facilities, or services; 

delays or decreases in the availability or capacity to transport, gather, or process production; 

changes in the status of pipelines that we depend on for transportation of our production to the marketplace; 

extensive governmental regulation (including regulations that may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for pollution damage or require posting substantial bonds to address decommissioning and plugging and abandonment P A costs) and interruption or termination of operations by governmental authorities based on environmental, safety, or other considerations; and/or 

changes in the regulatory environment such as the new guidelines recently issued by BOEM related to financial assurance requirements to cover decommissioning obligations for operations on the OCS. 

 Because all or a number of our properties could experience many of the same conditions at the same time, these conditions may have a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other producers who have properties over a wider geographic area. 
 We may experience significant shut-ins and losses of production due to the effects of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 Our production is primarily associated with our properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf Coast. Accordingly, if the level of production from these properties substantially declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue. We are particularly vulnerable to significant risk from hurricanes and tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico. We are unable to predict what impact future hurricanes and tropical storms might have on our future results of operations and production. 
 55 

A significant portion of o ur production, revenue and cash flow is concentrated in our Phoenix Field. Because of this concentration, any production problems, impacts of adverse weather or inaccuracies in reserve estimates could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 For the six months ended June 30, 2018, approximately 51 of our production and 63 of our oil, natural gas, and NGL revenue was attributable to our Phoenix Field, which is located offshore Louisiana. This concentration in the Phoenix Field means that any impact on our production from the Phoenix Field, whether because of mechanical problems, adverse weather, well containment activities, changes in the regulatory environment, or otherwise, could have a material effect on our business. We produce the Phoenix Field through the Helix Producer I HP-1 a dynamically positioned floating production facility that is operated by Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. Helix ). The HP-I interconnects the Phoenix Field through a production buoy that can be disconnected if the HP-I cannot maintain its position on station, such as in the event of a mechanical problem with the dynamic positioning system or the approach of a hurricane. Because the HP-I may have to be disconnected from the Phoenix Field if circumstances require, our production from the Phoenix Field may be subject to more frequent interruptions than if the Phoenix Field was produced by a more conventional platform. 
 We are expected to have general liability insurance coverage with an annual aggregate limit of 500 million. We selectively purchase physical damage insurance coverage for our pipelines, platforms, facilities, and umbilicals for losses resulting from named windstorms and operational activities. 
 56 

Our operational control of well coverage is expected to provide limits that vary by well location and depth and range from a combined single limit of 25 million to 500 million per occurrence. Under our service agreements, including drilling contracts, we expect to be indemnified for injuri es and death of the service provider s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider. 
 An operational or hurricane or other adverse weather-related event may cause damage or liability in excess of our coverage that might severely impact our financial position. We may be liable for damages from an event relating to a project in which we own a non-operating working interest. These laws and regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions. Regulated matters include: permits for exploration, development and production operations; limitations on our drilling activities in environmentally sensitive areas, such as marine habitats, and restrictions on the way we can discharge materials into the environment; bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment and other decommissioning costs; reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells and unitization and pooling of properties; regulations regarding the rate, terms and conditions of transportation service or the price, terms, and conditions related to the purchase and sale of oil and natural gas; and taxation. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the issuance of remedial obligations and the imposition of injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain of our operations. offshore facilities to prove that they have the financial capability to respond to costs that may be incurred in connection with potential oil spills. Under the OPA and other environmental statutes such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA ), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA and analogous state laws, owners and operators of certain defined onshore and offshore facilities are strictly liable for spills of oil and other regulated substances, subject to certain limitations. Consequently, a spill from one of our facilities subject to laws such as the OPA, CERCLA and RCRA could require the expenditure of additional, and potentially significant, amounts of capital, or could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlyi ng assumptions materially affects the quantities and present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Three-dimensional seismic interpretation does not guarantee that hydrocarbons are present or if present produces in economic quantities. 
 We rely on 3D seismic studies to assist us with assessing prospective drilling opportunities on our properties, as well as on properties that we may acquire. Such seismic studies are merely an interpretive tool and do not necessarily guarantee that hydrocarbons are present or, if present, produce in economic quantities, and seismic indications of hydrocarbon saturation are generally not reliable indicators of productive reservoir rock. These limitations of 3D seismic data may impact our drilling and operational results, and consequently our financial condition. The lack of availability or capacity of these gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. The disruption of these gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities due to maintenance and/or weather could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. Federal, state, and local regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market our oil and natural gas. These forecasts are based on a number of estimates, including expectations of production from existing wells. In addition, our forecasts may assume that none of the risks associated with our oil and natural gas operations summarized in this section would occur, such as facility or equipment malfunctions, adverse weather effects, or significant declines in commodity prices or material increases in costs, which could make certain production uneconomical. 
 Our operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and natural gas drilling and production activities. Oil and natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened, delayed, or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: 

unexpected drilling conditions; 

pressure or irregularities in formations; 

equipment failures or accidents; 

hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions; 

shortages in experienced labor; and 

shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. 

 The prevailing prices of oil and natural gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs, production equipment, and related services. 
 Our industry experiences numerous operating risks. 
 The exploration, development and production of oil and gas properties involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, pipe failure, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards. Environmental hazards include oil spills, gas leaks, pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. We are also involved in completion operations that utilize hydraulic fracturing, which may potentially present additional operational and environmental risks. Additionally, our offshore operations are subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and adverse weather and sea conditions, including the effects of hurricanes. 
 In addition, an oil spill on or related to our properties and operations could expose us to joint and several strict liability, without regard to fault, under applicable law for containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil, natural resource damages and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill. If an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur, we could be liable for costs and damages, which costs and damages could be material to our results of operations and financial position. 
 Our business is also subject to the risks and uncertainties normally associated with the exploration for and development and production of oil and natural gas that are beyond our control, including uncertainties as to the presence, size and recoverability of hydrocarbons. We may not encounter commercially productive oil and natural gas reservoirs. 
 If any of these industry operating risks occur, we could have substantial losses. Substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, suspension of operations and production and repairs to resume operations. Any of these industry operating risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As a result, we may significantly increase or decrease our estimated asset retirement obligations in future periods. For example, because we operate in the Gulf of Mexico, platforms, facilities and equipment are subject to damage or destruction as a result of hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. The estimated costs to plug and abandon a well or dismantle a platform can change dramatically if the host platform from which the work was anticipated to be performed is damaged or toppled rather than structurally intact. Accordingly, our estimates of future asset retirement obligations could differ dramatically from what we may ultimately incur as a result of damage from a hurricane or other natural disaster. Also, a sustained lower commodity price environment may cause our non-operator partners to be unable to pay their share of costs, which may require us to pay our proportionate share of the defaulting party s share of costs. 
 In addition, integrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks and unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and in retaining and assimilating employees. These difficulties include, among other things: 

operating a larger organization; 

coordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities; 

integrating corporate, technological and administrative functions; 

diverting management s attention from regular business concerns; 

diverting financial resources away from existing operations; 

increasing our indebtedness; and 

incurring potential environmental or regulatory liabilities and title problems. 

 Any of these or other similar risks could lead to potential adverse short-term or long-term effects on our operating results. In connection with potential future acquisitions, we may only be able to perform limited due diligence. 
 Successful acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing of recovering reserves, exploration potential, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities, including plugging and abandonment liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and may not disclose all material issues or liabilities. In addition, our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. 
 There may be threatened, contemplated, asserted, or other claims against the acquired assets related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation, or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues, and results of operations. We may be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, but we expect that we will generally acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. In addition, even if we are able to obtain such indemnification from the sellers, these indemnification obligations usually expire over time and could potentially expose us to unindemnified liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our production, revenues, and results of operations. The success and timing of development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others depends upon a number of factors that could be largely outside of our control, including: 

the timing and amount of capital expenditures; 

the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel; 

the operator s expertise and financial resources; 

approval of other participants in drilling wells; 

risk of other non-operator s failing to pay its share of costs, which may require us to pay our proportionate share of the defaulting party s share of costs; 

selection of technology; 

the rate of production of the reserves; and 

the timing and cost of P A operations. 

 In addition, with respect to oil and natural gas projects that we do not operate, we have limited influence over operations, including limited control over the maintenance of safety and environmental standards. The operators of those properties may, depending on the terms of the applicable joint operating agreement: 

refuse to initiate exploration or development projects; 

initiate exploration or development projects on a slower or faster schedule than we would prefer; 

delay the pace of exploratory drilling or development; and/or 

drill more wells or build more facilities on a project than we can afford, whether on a cash basis or through financing, which may limit our participation in those projects or limit the percentage of our revenues from those projects. Any significant variance of our current interpretation of such legislation from any future regulations or interpretive guidance could result in a change to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could negatively affect our business. 
 Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce. 
 Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, greenhouse gas reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain sources. At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented. The EPA, however, has adopted regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act (the CAA ). The EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the CAA, one of which requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources through preconstruction and operating permit requirements. 
 The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, on an annual basis. Recent regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases has focused on fugitive methane emissions. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that established new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission, and storage activities. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the 2016 rule for two years and to reconsider the entirety of the 2016 rule, but the agency has not yet published a final rule and, as a result, the 2016 rule is currently in effect but future implementation of the 2016 rule is uncertain. Compliance with these rules if fully or partially implemented could result in increased compliance costs on our operations. 
 68 

In addition, while the United States Congress has not taken any legislative action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, many states have established greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal. 
 Additionally, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to the Paris Agreement, an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own greenhouse gas emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country uses to achieve its greenhouse gas emissions targets. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016. The United States adherence to the exit process is uncertain and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. 
 The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or to comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Substantial limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lowers the value of our reserves. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, with concerns over GHG emissions, certain non-governmental activists have recently directed their efforts at advocating the shifting of funding away from companies with energy-related assets, which could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. 
 In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury, property damage, or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. 
 Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, and other climatic events. Our offshore operations are particularly at risk from severe climatic events. If any such climate changes were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 The enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices, such transactions, depending on the hedging instrument used, may limit our potential gains if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: 

our production is less than expected or is shut-in for extended periods due to hurricanes or other factors; 

there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point to be assumed in the hedge arrangement; 

the counterparties to our futures contracts fails to perform the contracts; 

a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices; or 

 70 

we are unable to market our production in a manner contemplated when entering in to the hedge contract. 

 All of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments are with certain lenders or affiliates of the lenders under our Bank Credit Facility.","['However, it does not include 3,100 barrels equivalent a day of production that was deferred due to a tropical storm in the third quarter and an unplanned downtime event in the Helix-Producer 1, which is the host facility for our Phoenix Complex in the Green Canyon area. Although any downtime in our biggest asset is certainly felt, we account for some downtime, particularly during hurricane season as part of our guidance. \nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter, inclusive our hedge settlement, was $157 million for a netback EBITDA margin of $31.08 per BOE, while our unhedged adjusted EBITDA was $198 million for a netback margin of $39.15 per BOE, both an increase from the second quarter.']",negative,both_RF_Mgm,treatment,79444,0.0,5.0,-0.9999998,negative,0.9447155,4.0,0.0,2.0,119.0,0.0336134453781512,0.0,0.0168067226890756
"The increase in oil production volumes was attributable to 19.0 MBblpd from the Stone Combination and the Whistler Acquisition and 3.1 MBblpd from the Tornado II well in the Phoenix Field which commenced initial production in December 2017. The increase was partially offset by 2.4 MBblpd deferred production from the Phoenix Field for unplanned third party downtime for the HP-I and 0.7 MBblpd related to shut-in production for three days due to Tropical Storm Gordon. 
 Natural gas revenue increased approximately 9.0 million, or 81 , during the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the corresponding period in 2017. Operations in the deepwater can result in increased operational risks as has been demonstrated by the Deepwater Horizon di saster in 2010. Despite technological advances since this disaster, liabilities for environmental losses, personal injury and loss of life and significant regulatory fines in the event of a disaster could be well in excess of insured amounts and result in significant current losses on our statements of operations as well as going concern issues. 
 Oil Spill Response Plan. We maintain a Regional Oil Spill Response Plan that defines our response requirements, procedures and remediation plans in the event we have an oil spill. Oil Spill Response Plans are generally approved by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement BSEE bi-annually, except when changes are required, in which case revised plans are required to be submitted for approval at the time changes are made. Additionally, these plans are tested and drills are conducted periodically at all levels. 
 Hurricanes. Since our operations are in the Gulf of Mexico, we are particularly vulnerable to the effects of hurricanes on production. Additionally, affordable insurance coverage for property damage to our facilities for hurricanes has become less effective due to rising retentions and limitations on named windstorm coverage and has been difficult to obtain at times in recent years. Significant hurricane impacts could include reductions and/or deferrals of future oil and natural gas production and revenues, increased lease operating expenses for evacuations and repairs and possible acceleration of plugging and abandonment costs. 
 Commitments and Contingencies

 We caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks inc lude, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, inflation, lack of availability of drilling and production equipment and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, well control risk, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inh erent in estimating reserves and in projecting future rates of production, cash flow and access to capital, the timing of development expenditures, potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relations resulting from the business combina tion between Talos Energy LLC and Stone Energy Corporation, competitive responses to such business combination, the possibility that the anticipated benefits of such business combination are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of th e impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies, litigation relating to the business combination, and the other risks discussed in . 
 Item 1A. The high, low and average prices for NYMEX WTI and NYMEX Henry Hub are monthly contract prices. The prices we receive for our oil and natural gas depend upon many factors beyond our control, including, among others: 

changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas; 

market uncertainty; 

level of consumer product demands; 

hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions; 

domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; 

price and availability of alternative fuels;

political and economic conditions in oil-producing countries, particularly those in the Middle East, Russia, South America and Africa; 

actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil and natural gas price and production controls; 

U.S. and foreign supply of oil and natural gas; 

price and quantity of oil and natural gas imports and exports; 

the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production; 

the level of global oil and natural gas inventories; 

localized supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability; 

speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts; 

price and availability of competitors supplies of oil and natural gas; 

technological advances affecting energy consumption; and 

overall domestic and foreign economic conditions. Because oil, natural gas and NGLs accounted for approximately 72 , 21 and 7 , respectively, of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, and approximately 67 , 26 and 7 , respectively, of our 2017 production on an MBoe basis, our financial results will be sensitive to movements in oil, natural gas and NGL prices.

We are r equired to meet a minimum work program expressed in work units during a four-year exploration period according to one of our PSCs with the National Hydrocarbons Commission of Mexico (the CNH ). 
 On September 4, 2015, our subsidiary Talos Energy LLC, together with its consortium partners Sierra Oil Gas S. 
 BSEE and BOEM have imposed new and more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these added and more stringent regulatory requirements and with existing environmental and spill regulations, together with uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies and delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill response, and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. Moreover, these governmental agencies are continuing to evaluate aspects of safety and operational performance in the Gulf of Mexico and, as a result, are continuing to develop and implement new, more restrictive requirements. For example, in April 2016, BSEE published a final rule on well control that, among other things, imposes rigorous standards relating to the design, operation, and maintenance of blow-out preventers, real-time monitoring of deepwater and high temperature, high pressure drilling activities, and enhanced reporting requirements. Pursuant to President Trump s Executive Orders dated March 28, 2017, and April 28, 2017 (the Executive Orders ), respectively, BSEE initiated a review of the well control regulations to determine whether the rules are consistent with the stated policy of encouraging energy exploration and production, while ensuring that any such activity is safe and environmentally responsible. One consequence of this review is that on September 28, 2018, BSEE published final revisions to its regulations regarding offshore drilling safety equipment, which includes the removal of the requirement for offshore operators to certify through an independent third party that their critical safety and pollution prevention equipment e.g. , subsea safety equipment, including blowout preventers) is operational and functioning as designed in the most extreme conditions. 
 Also, in April 2016, BOEM published a proposed rule that would update existing air emissions requirements relating to offshore oil and natural gas activity on the OCS. BOEM regulates these air emissions in connection with its review of exploration and development plans, rights of way and rights of use, and/or easement applications. The proposed rule would bolster existing air emissions requirements by, among other things, requiring the reporting and tracking of the emissions of all pollutants defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA to affect human health and public welfare. Pursuant to the Executive Orders, BOEM has ceased rulemaking activities for and is reviewing the proposed air quality rule. Additionally, if left unchanged, the existing, or future, more stringent oil and gas safety and performance-related regulations and other regulatory initiatives imposed by BOEM and BSEE could result in increased financial assurance requirements and incurrence of associated added costs, limit operational activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities. Also, if material spill incidents were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries where such an event may occur could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws or regulations on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover some or all of the risks associated with such operations. These and other changes to BOEM bonding and financial assurance requirements could result in increased costs on our operations and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 65 

We have a subsidiary that is subject to a plea agreement with the Department of Justice DOJ pursuant to which certain exploration and production activities must comply with a Safety and Environmental Compliance Program SEC P ). Noncompliance with the SECP could result in a violation of the plea agreement and provide a basis for revocation or modification of probation. The Court placed ERT on probation for three years. The conditions of probation include compliance with an agreed SECP, pursuant to which ERT and another subsidiary of ours must implement enhanced safety and environmental compliance inspections, reviews and audits, implement a comprehensive training program, implement enhanced operational controls to better manage, detect and prevent safety and environmental violations, and preparation and implementation of schedule for decommissioning. Any failure to comply with the SECP could result in a violation of the plea agreement and provide a basis for revocation or modification of probation, which could adversely our financial condition and operations. A further reduction in commodity prices may result in a further decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production. 
 Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including: 

our proved reserves; 

the level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from our wells; 

the prices at which our production is sold; 

our ability to acquire, locate, and produce new reserves; and 

our ability to borrow under our Bank Credit Facility. 

 66 

If low oil and natural gas pric es, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, or other factors, many of which are beyond our control, cause our revenues, cash flows from operating activities, and the borrowing base under our Bank Credit Facility to decrease, we may be limited in our ability to fund the capital necessary to complete our capital expenditure program. Unlike other entities that are geographically diversified, we may not have the resources to effectively diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. Our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive, and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have an adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we operate, and result in our dependency upon a single or limited number of hydrocarbon basins. In addition, the geographic concentration of our properties in the Gulf of Mexico and in the shallow waters off the coast of Mexico means that some or all of the properties could be affected should the region experience: 

severe weather, such as hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions; 

delays or decreases in production, the availability of equipment, facilities, or services; 

delays or decreases in the availability or capacity to transport, gather, or process production; 

changes in the status of pipelines that we depend on for transportation of our production to the marketplace; 

extensive governmental regulation (including regulations that may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for pollution damage or require posting substantial bonds to address decommissioning and plugging and abandonment P A costs) and interruption or termination of operations by governmental authorities based on environmental, safety, or other considerations; and/or 

changes in the regulatory environment such as the new guidelines recently issued by BOEM related to financial assurance requirements to cover decommissioning obligations for operations on the OCS. 

 Because all or a number of our properties could experience many of the same conditions at the same time, these conditions may have a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other producers who have properties over a wider geographic area. 
 67 

We may experience significant shut-ins and losses of production due to the effects of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and in the shallow waters off the coast of Mexico. 
 Our production is primarily associated with our properties in the Gulf of Mexico and in the shallow waters off the coast of Mexico. Accordingly, if the level of production from these properties substantially declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue. We are particularly vulnerable to significant risk from hurricanes and tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico. We are unable to predict what impact future hurricanes and tropical storms might have on our future results of operations and production. 
 A significant portion of our production, revenue and cash flow is concentrated in our Phoenix Field and our Pompano Field. Because of this concentration, any production problems, impacts of adverse weather or inaccuracies in reserve estimates could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2018, approximately 51 of our production and 56 of our oil, natural gas, and NGL revenue was attributable to our Phoenix Field and our Pompano Field, both of which are located in the federal waters offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. This concentration in these fields means that any impact on our production from these fields, whether because of mechanical problems, adverse weather, well containment activities, changes in the regulatory environment, or otherwise, could have a material effect on our business. We produce the Phoenix Field through the Helix Producer I HP-I a dynamically positioned floating production facility that is operated by Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. Helix ). The HP-I interconnects the Phoenix Field through a production buoy that can be disconnected if the HP-I cannot maintain its position on station, such as in the event of a mechanical problem with the dynamic positioning system or the approach of a hurricane. Because the HP-I may have to be disconnected from the Phoenix Field if circumstances require, our production from the Phoenix Field may be subject to more frequent interruptions than if the Phoenix Field was produced by a more conventional platform. We insure some, but not all, of our properties from operational loss-related events. We have insurance policies that include coverage for general liability, physical damage to our oil and gas properties, operational control of well, named Gulf of Mexico windstorm, oil pollution, construction all risk, workers compensation and employers liability, and other coverage. Our insurance coverage includes deductibles that have to be met prior to recovery, as well as sub-limits or self-insurance. 
 We have general liability insurance coverage with an annual aggregate limit of 500 million. We selectively purchase physical damage insurance coverage for our pipelines, platforms, facilities, and umbilicals for losses resulting from named windstorms and operational activities. 
 Our operational control of well coverage is expected to provide limits that vary by well location and depth and range from a combined single limit of 25 million to 500 million per occurrence. Under our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally we are indemnified for injuries and death of the service provider s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider, subject to the application of various states laws. 
 An operational or hurricane or other adverse weather-related event may cause damage or liability in excess of our coverage that might severely impact our financial position. We may be liable for damages from an event relating to a project in which we own a non-operating working interest. These laws and regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions. Regulated matters include: permits for exploration, development and production operations; limitations on our drilling activities in environmentally sensitive areas, such as marine habitats, and restrictions on the way we can discharge materials into the environment; bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well P A and other decommissioning costs; reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells and unitization and pooling of properties; regulations regarding the rate, terms and conditions of transportation service or the price, terms, and conditions related to the purchase and sale of oil and natural gas; and taxation. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the issuance of remedial obligations and the imposition of injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain of our operations. offshore facilities to prove that they have the financial capability to respond to costs that may be inc urred in connection with potential oil spills. Under the OPA and other environmental statutes such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA ), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA and analogous sta te laws, owners and operators of certain defined onshore and offshore facilities are strictly liable for spills of oil and other regulated substances, subject to certain limitations. Consequently, a spill from one of our facilities subject to laws such as the OPA, CERCLA and RCRA could require the expenditure of additional, and potentially significant, amounts of capital, or could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. We cannot pr edict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their impact on our earnings, operations or competitive position. 
 Our Mexican operations are subject to certain offshore regulatory and environmental laws and regulations promulgated by Mexico. 
 Our operations on oil and natural gas blocks in shallow waters off the coast of Mexico s Veracruz and Tabasco states, and in other Mexican offshore areas where we are assessing other exploration opportunities, are subject to regulation by the Secretariat of Energy SENER ), the CNH and other Mexican regulatory bodies. The PSCs that we and our consortium partners have entered into for the development of these acreages contain terms that impose on us the duty to comply with various laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons (including certain national content requirements), the treatment, conveyance, marketing, transport and storage of petroleum, and requirements for industrial safety, operational security, and facility decommissioning. Failure to comply can result in the imposition of monetary penalties, revocation of permits, rescission of the relevant PSC, suspension of operations, and ordered decommissioning of offshore facilities and systems. Such regulations are subject to change, and it is possible that SENER, the CNH or other Mexican regulatory bodies may impose new or revised requirements that could increase our operating costs and/or capital expenditures for operations in Mexican offshore waters. 
 In addition, our operations on oil and natural gas blocks in shallow waters off the coast of Mexico s Veracruz and Tabasco states, and in other Mexican offshore areas where we are assessing other exploration opportunities, are subject to regulation by the Mexican National Agency of Industrial Safety and Environmental Protection of the Hydrocarbons Sector ASEA ). We must obtain ASEA-issued permits and comply with ASEA regulations governing hydrocarbon activities, including requirements for environmental impact and risk assessments, industrial safety, waste management, water and air emissions, operational security, and facility decommissioning. Under the PSCs, we are jointly and severally liable, along with Sierra and Premier, for the performance of all obligations under the PSCs, including exploration, appraisal, extraction, and abandonment activities and compliance with all environmental regulations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in the imposition of monetary penalties, revocation of permits, suspension of operations, and ordered decommissioning of offshore facilities and systems. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underly ing assumptions materially affects the quantities and present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Three-dimensional seismic interpretation does not guarantee that hydrocarbons are present or if present produces in economic quantities. 
 We rely on 3D seismic studies to assist us with assessing prospective drilling opportunities on our properties, as well as on properties that we may acquire. Such seismic studies are merely an interpretive tool and do not necessarily guarantee that hydrocarbons are present or, if present, produce in economic quantities, and seismic indications of hydrocarbon saturation are generally not reliable indicators of productive reservoir rock. These limitations of 3D seismic data may impact our drilling and operational results, and consequently our financial condition. The lack of availability or capacity of these gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. The disruption of these gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities due to maintenance and/or weather could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. Federal, state, and local regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market our oil and natural gas. These forecasts are based on a number of estimates, including expectations of production from existing wells. In addition, our forecasts may assume that none of the risks associated with our oil and natural gas operations summarized in this section would occur, such as facility or equipment malfunctions, adverse weather effects, or significant declines in commodity prices or material increases in costs, which could make certain production uneconomical. 
 Our operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and natural gas drilling and production activities. Oil and natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened, delayed, or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: 

unexpected drilling conditions; 

pressure or irregularities in formations; 

equipment failures or accidents; 

hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions; 

shortages in experienced labor; and 

shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. 

 The prevailing prices of oil and natural gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs, production equipment, and related services. 
 Our industry experiences numerous operating risks. 
 The exploration, development and production of oil and gas properties involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, pipe failure, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards. Environmental hazards include oil spills, gas leaks, pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. We are also involved in completion operations that utilize hydraulic fracturing, which may potentially present additional operational and environmental risks. Additionally, our offshore operations are subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collisions and adverse weather and sea conditions, including the effects of hurricanes. 
 In addition, an oil spill on or related to our properties and operations could expose us to joint and several strict liability, without regard to fault, under applicable law for containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil, natural resource damages and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill. If an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur, we could be liable for costs and damages, which costs and damages could be material to our results of operations and financial position. 
 Our business is also subject to the risks and uncertainties normally associated with the exploration for and development and production of oil and natural gas that are beyond our control, including uncertainties as to the presence, size and recoverability of hydrocarbons. We may not encounter commercially productive oil and natural gas reservoirs. 
 If any of these industry operating risks occur, we could have substantial losses. Substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, suspension of operations and production and repairs to resume operations. Any of these industry operating risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As a result, we may significantly increase or decrease our estimated asset retirement obligations in future periods. For example, because we operate in the Gulf of Mexico, platforms, facilities and equipment are subject to damage or destruction as a result of hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. The estimated costs to plug and abandon a well or dismantle a platform can change dramatically if the host platform from which the work was anticipated to be performed is damaged or toppled rather than structurally intact. Accordingly, our estimates of future asset retirement obligations could differ dramatically from what we may ultimately incur as a result of damage from a hurricane or other natural disaster. Also, a sustained lower commodity price environment may cause our non-operator partners to be unable to pay their share of costs, which may require us to pay our proportionate share of the defaulting party s share of costs. 
 In addition, integrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks and unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and in retaining and assimilating employees. These difficulties include, among other things: 

operating a larger organization; 

coordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities; 

integrating corporate, technological and administrative functions; 

diverting management s attention from regular business concerns; 

diverting financial resources away from existing operations; 

increasing our indebtedness; and 

incurring potential environmental or regulatory liabilities and title problems. 

 Any of these or other similar risks could lead to potential adverse short-term or long-term effects on our operating results. In connection with potential future acquisitions, we may only be able to perform limited due diligence. 
 Successful acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing of recovering reserves, exploration potential, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities, including P A liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and may not disclose all material issues or liabilities. In addition, our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. 
 There may be threatened, contemplated, asserted, or other claims against the acquired assets related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation, or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues, and results of operations. We may be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, but we expect that we will generally acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. In addition, even if we are able to obtain such indemnification from the sellers, these indemnification obligations usually expire over time and could potentially expose us to unindemnified liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our production, revenues, and results of operations. The success and timing of development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others depends upon a number of factors that could be largely outside of our control, including: 

the timing and amount of capital expenditures; 

the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel; 

the operator s expertise and financial resources; 

approval of other participants in drilling wells; 

risk of other non-operator s failing to pay its share of costs, which may require us to pay our proportionate share of the defaulting party s share of costs; 

selection of technology; 

the rate of production of the reserves; and 

the timing and cost of P A operations. 

 In addition, with respect to oil and natural gas projects that we do not operate, we have limited influence over operations, including limited control over the maintenance of safety and environmental standards. The operators of those properties may, depending on the terms of the applicable joint operating agreement: 
 79 

refuse to initiate exploration or development projects; 

initiate exploration or development projects on a slower or faster schedule than we would prefer; 

delay the pace of exploratory drilling or development; and/or 

drill more wells or build more facilities on a project than we can afford, whether on a cash basis or through financing, which may limit our participation in those projects or limit the percentage of our revenues from those projects. Any significant variance of our current interpretation of such legislation from any future regulations or interpretive guidance could result in a change to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could negatively affect our business. 
 Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce. 
 Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, greenhouse gas reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain sources. At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented. The EPA, however, has adopted regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act (the CAA ). The EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the CAA, one of which requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources through preconstruction and operating permit requirements. 
 81 

The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, on an annual basis. Recent regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases has focused on fugitive methane emissi ons. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that established new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission, and storage activities. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the 2016 rule for two years and to reconsider the entirety of the 2016 rule, but the agency has not yet published a final rule. Instead, in February 2 018, the EPA finalized amendments to certain requirements of the rule, and in September 2018 the EPA proposed additional amendments, including rescission of certain requirements and revisions to other requirements, such as fugitive emission monitoring freq uency. As a result, the 2016 rule is currently in effect but future implementation of the 2016 rule is uncertain. Compliance with these rules if fully or partially implemented could result in increased compliance costs on our operations. 
 In addition, while the United States Congress has not taken any legislative action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, many states have established greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal. 
 Additionally, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to the Paris Agreement, an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own greenhouse gas emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country uses to achieve its greenhouse gas emissions targets. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016. The United States adherence to the exit process is uncertain and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. 
 The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or to comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Substantial limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lowers the value of our reserves. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, with concerns over greenhouse gas emissions, certain non-governmental activists have recently directed their efforts at advocating the shifting of funding away from companies with energy-related assets, which could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. 
 In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury, property damage, or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. 
 Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, and other climatic events. Our offshore operations are particularly at risk from severe climatic events. If any such climate changes were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 82 

The enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our busine ss. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices, such transactions, depending on the hedging instrument used, may limit our potential gains if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: 

our production is less than expected or is shut-in for extended periods due to hurricanes or other factors; 

there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point to be assumed in the hedge arrangement; 

the counterparties to our futures contracts fails to perform the contracts; 

a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices; or 

we are unable to market our production in a manner contemplated when entering into the hedge contract. 

 All of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments are with certain lenders or affiliates of the lenders under our Bank Credit Facility.","['However, it does not include 3,100 barrels equivalent a day of production that was deferred due to a tropical storm in the third quarter and an unplanned downtime event in the Helix-Producer 1, which is the host facility for our Phoenix Complex in the Green Canyon area.

Goodwill 

Goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of
 net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
 impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or
 circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate,
 indicate that there may be justification for conducting an
 interim test. The Company performs its annual goodwill
 impairment testing during the third quarter of each year based
 upon data as of the close of the second quarter.

Impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach,
 which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the
 reporting unit level. Under the reform plan, which is
 effective January 1, 2008, the Company retains the
 obligation for administering certain existing and future
 participants accounts for which they receive no revenue.
 Also contributing is an increase in commissions on bancassurance
 business, an increase in retention incentives related to pension
 reform, the impact of management s update of DAC
 assumptions as a result of pension reform and growth, partially
 offset by a lower increase in liabilities due to inflation and
 exchange rate indexing.

South Korea by 92 million, primarily due to the favorable
 impact in 2006 of 60 million in DAC amortization
 associated with the implementation of a more refined reserve
 valuation system and additional expenses in 2007 associated with
 growth and infrastructure initiatives, as well as business
 growth and higher bank insurance fees, partially offset by a
 decrease in DAC amortization related to market performance.

Mexico by 27 million primarily due to higher expenses
 related to business growth and the favorable impact in 2006 of
 liabilities related to employment matters that were reduced,
 offset by a decrease in DAC amortization resulting from
 management s update of assumptions used to determine
 estimated gross profits in both the current and prior years, and
 a decrease in liabilities based on a review of outstanding
 remittances.

India by 14 million primarily due to headcount increases
 and growth initiatives, partially offset by the impact of
 management s update of assumptions used to determine
 estimated gross profits.

Australia by 12 million primarily due to business growth
 and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Chile by 12 million primarily due to higher compensation
 costs, higher spending on infrastructure and marketing programs
 and growth, partially offset by a decrease in DAC amortization
 related to inflation indexing.

Hong Kong by 11 million due to the acquisition of the
 remaining 50 interest in MetLife Fubon and the resulting
 consolidation of the operation.

Ireland by 10 million due to additional
 start-up 
 costs, as well as 5 million of foreign currency
 transaction losses.

Brazil by 9 million primarily due to changes in foreign
 currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in
 litigation liabilities in 2006.

The United Kingdom by 2 million due to changes in foreign
 currency rates and higher spending on business initiatives,
 partially offset by lower DAC amortization resulting from
 calculation refinements.

Partially offsetting these increases in other expenses were
 decreases in:

Taiwan by 118 million primarily due to a one-time increase
 in DAC amortization in 2006 of 77 million due to a loss
 recognition adjustment resulting from low interest rates
 relative to product guarantees coupled with high persistency
 rates on certain blocks of business, an increase in DAC
 amortization in 2006 associated with the implementation of a new
 valuation system, expenses of 17 million in 2006 related
 the termination of the agency distribution channel and expense
 reductions recognized in 2007 due to elimination of the agency
 distribution channel.

The home office of 4 million primarily due to the
 elimination of certain intercompany expenses previously charged
 to the International Segment, offset by higher spending on
 growth and infrastructure initiatives.

Decreases in other countries accounted for the remainder of the
 change.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a
 105 million increase in total expenses.

Net
 Income 

Net income decreased by 161 million, or 37 , to
 275 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
 436 million for the comparable 2007 period.

The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to an
 increase in net investment losses of 98 million, net of
 income tax, and an increase in policyholder benefits and claims
 of 75 million, net of income tax.

The increase in net investment losses is due to an increase in
 losses on fixed maturity and equity securities. The increase in
 losses on fixed maturity and equity securities is primarily
 attributable to an increase in impairments associated with
 financial services industry holdings which experienced losses as
 a result of bankruptcies, FDIC receivership, and federal
 government assisted capital market infusion transactions in the
 third and fourth quarters of 2008, as well as other credit
 related impairments or losses on fixed maturity and equity
 securities where the Company did not intend to hold securities
 until recovery in conjunction with overall market declines
 occurring throughout the year.

The increase in policyholder benefits and claims of
 75 million, net of income tax, was comprised primarily of
 an increase of 134 million, net of income tax, in
 catastrophe losses resulting from severe thunderstorms and
 tornadoes in the Midwestern and Southern states in the second
 quarter of the current year and hurricanes Ike, Gustav and Hanna
 in the third quarter of the current year, offset by
 20 million, net of income tax, of additional favorable
 development of prior years catastrophe losses and loss
 adjustment expenses, primarily from hurricane Katrina. A
 decrease in non-catastrophe policyholder benefits and claims
 improved net income by 39 million, net of income tax,
 resulting from 51 million, net of income tax, of lower
 losses due to lower severity in the auto line of business and
 8 million, net of income tax, of additional favorable
 development of prior year non-catastrophe losses and
 8 million, net of income tax, in unallocated loss
 adjustment expenses, primarily from lower employee costs, offset
 by an increase of 23 million, net of income tax, from
 higher non-catastrophe claim frequencies primarily in the
 homeowners line of business and a 5 million, net of income
 tax, increase related to higher earned exposures.

Offsetting this decrease in net income was an increase in
 premiums of 3 million, net of income tax, comprised of an
 increase of 11 million, net of income tax, related to
 increased exposures and an increase of 16 million, net of
 income tax, from a decrease in catastrophe reinsurance costs.
 Offsetting these increases in premiums was a decrease of
 20 million, net of income tax, related to a reduction in
 average earned premium per policy and a decrease of
 4 million, net of income tax, in premiums from various
 involuntary programs.

In addition, net investment income decreased by 6 million,
 net of income tax, primarily due to a smaller asset base.

Also impacting net income was a decrease of 16 million,
 net of income tax, in other expenses and a decrease of
 3 million, net of income tax, in other revenues.

Income taxes contributed 2 million to net income over the
 expected amount primarily due to favorable resolution of a prior
 year audit. These
 increases in premiums were offset by a decrease of
 28 million related to a reduction in average earned
 premium per policy and a decrease of 6 million in premiums
 primarily from various involuntary programs.

Net investment income decreased by 10 million primarily
 due to a smaller asset base. Other revenues decreased
 5 million primarily related to slower than anticipated
 claims payments resulting in slower recognition of deferred
 income in 2008 related to a reinsurance contract as compared to
 2007 and less income from COLI.

Expenses 

Total expenses increased by 88 million, or 3 , to
 2,728 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
 from 2,640 million for the comparable 2007 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims increased by 112 million
 due to an increase of 202 million in catastrophe losses
 primarily resulting from severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in
 the Midwestern and Southern states in the second quarter of the
 current year and hurricanes Ike, Gustav and Hanna in the third
 quarter of the current year, offset by 31 million of
 additional favorable development of prior years 
 catastrophe losses and adjusting expenses, primarily from
 hurricane Katrina. Non-catastrophe policyholder benefits and
 claims decreased 59 million resulting from
 79 million of lower losses due to lower severities,
 primarily in the auto line of business, 11 million of
 additional favorable development of prior year losses and a
 12 million decrease in unallocated loss adjustment
 expenses primarily from lower employee costs, offset by an
 increase of 34 million from higher non-catastrophe claim
 frequencies, primarily in the homeowners line of business and a
 9 million increase related to earned exposures.

Other expenses decreased by 25 million resulting mainly
 from a 21 million decrease in commissions, a
 3 million decrease in surveys and underwriting reports and
 a 5 million decrease in other sales related expenses,
 offset by a 13 million change in deferred acquisition
 costs, all due to a decrease in policy activity, a decrease of
 4 million related to a 2007 charge for structured
 settlements and a 5 million decrease from other minor
 fluctuations in a number of expense categories. Offsetting

these increases was a 41 million, net of income tax,
 decrease in catastrophe losses, which included favorable
 development of 2006 catastrophe liabilities of 10 million,
 net of income tax.

In addition, there was a decrease of 1 million, net of
 income tax, in policyholder dividends that positively impacted
 net income.

Also favorably impacting net income was a reduction of
 11 million, net of income tax, in other expenses related
 to lower information technology and advertising costs.

Revenues 

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
 increased by 82 million, or 3 , to 3,205 million for
 the year ended December 31, 2007 from 3,123 million
 for the comparable 2006 period.

Premiums increased by 42 million due principally to a
 59 million increase in premiums related to increased
 exposures, an increase of 5 million from various voluntary
 and involuntary programs and an increase in premiums of
 5 million, resulting from the change in estimate on auto
 rate refunds due to a regulatory examination. Offsetting these
 increases was a 21 million decrease related to a reduction
 in average earned premium per policy and an increase in
 catastrophe reinsurance costs of 6 million.

Net investment income increased by 19 million due to a
 realignment of economic capital and an increase in net
 investment income from higher yields, somewhat offset by a lower
 asset base.

In addition, other revenues increased 21 million due
 primarily to slower than anticipated claims payments resulting
 in slower recognition of deferred income in 2006 related to a
 reinsurance contract as compared to 2007.

Expenses 

Total expenses increased by 72 million, or 3 , to
 2,640 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
 from 2,568 million for the comparable 2006 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims increased by 90 million
 which was primarily due to an increase of 59 million from
 higher claim frequencies, as a result of a return to normal
 weather patterns in 2007 compared to the milder weather in 2006
 across the majority of the country, and a 25 million and
 30 million increase in losses related to higher severity
 and higher earned exposures, respectively. In addition, an
 increase of 20 million in unallocated loss adjustment
 expenses, primarily resulting from an increase in claims-related
 information technology costs, and a 19 million decrease in
 favorable development of 2006 losses, representing
 148 million of favorable development for 2007 as compared
 to 167 million for the 2006 period, increased policyholder
 benefits and claims. See Liquidity and Capital

 Capital Sources Remarketing of Securities and

Guarantees 

In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided
 certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties
 pursuant to which it may be required to make payments now or in
 the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition,
 investment and other transactions, the Company has provided
 indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax,
 environmental and other specific liabilities, and other
 indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other
 things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants
 provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of
 business, the Company provides indemnifications to
 counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the
 foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as
 third party lawsuits. The advances on these repurchase
 agreements are collateralized by residential mortgage-backed
 securities and residential mortgage loans with estimated fair
 values of 3.1 billion and 1.3 billion at
 December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Collateral
 for Securities Lending 

The Company has non-cash collateral for securities lending on
 deposit from customers, which cannot be sold or repledged, and
 which has not been recorded on its consolidated balance sheets.
 The amount of this collateral was 279 million and
 40 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
 respectively.

Goodwill 

Goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of
 net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
 impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or
 circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate,
 indicate that there may be justification for conducting an
 interim test. Impairment testing is performed using the fair
 value approach, which requires the use of estimates and
 judgment, at the reporting unit level. We periodically review our estimates
 of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them
 with our actual experience. We revise estimates, to the extent
 permitted or required under GAAP, if we determine that future
 expected experience differs from assumptions used in the
 development of actuarial liabilities.

The Company has experienced, and will likely in the future
 experience, catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism,
 and turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact
 on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including
 pandemics, hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes,
 explosions, severe winter weather (including snow, freezing
 water, ice storms and blizzards), fires and man-made events such
 as terrorist attacks. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the
 incidence, timing, severity or amount of losses from
 catastrophes and acts of terrorism, but we make broad use of
 catastrophic and non-catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk
 from these perils.

Cash
 requirements for the Company s regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their
 operational needs, funding their construction programs and payment of dividends
 to SCANA. The ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant
 investment, to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to
 install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations will depend
 on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms.
 Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates
 charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on
 historical costs. The COL application,
 which
 is expected to be completed and filed before the end of 2007, would be reviewed
 by the NRC for an estimated three years. While SCE G s current plans are to
 pursue the development of one or both of these nuclear units, these plans will
 continue to be influenced by many factors, including NRC licensing attainment,
 ongoing evaluation of relative construction and operating costs, the cost of
 competing fuels, regulatory and environmental requirements and financial market
 conditions.

ENVIRONMENTAL
 AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

The
 EPA
 has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative and the United States
 Department of Justice (DOJ) has brought suit against a number of utilities
 in
 federal court alleging violations of the Clean Air Act (CAA). At least two
 of
 these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions
 decided neither favorable to the industry. The Company has analyzed each
 of
 the activities covered by the EPA s requests and believes each of these
 activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair, replacement and
 maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior
 regulation and the contested revised regulation. The regulations also provide
 an
 exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of
 operation or production rate and from demand growth. 

The
 current state of continued DOJ enforcement actions continues to be the subject
 of industry-wide speculation, but it is possible that the EPA will commence
 enforcement actions against SCE G and GENCO, and the EPA has the authority
 to seek penalties at the rate of up to 27,500 per day for each violation.
 The
 EPA also could seek installation of BACT (or equivalent) at the three plants.
 The Company continues to believe that any enforcement actions relative to the
 Company s compliance with the CAA would be without merit. To meet compliance
 requirements for the years 2012 through 2016, the Company anticipates additional
 capital expenditures totaling approximately 480 million. 

See
 notes
 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information
 related to environmental matters (Note 5B) and regulatory matters (Note
 2). 

OTHER
 MATTERS

 June 2007 the Georgia Public Service
 Commission (GPSC) announced that SCANA Energy will continue to serve as

Accumulated
 deferred income tax liabilities arising from utility operations that have not
 been included in customer rates are recorded as a regulatory asset. 
Accumulated deferred income tax assets arising from deferred investment tax
 credits are recorded as a regulatory liability. Included in these amounts are regulatory assets
 or liabilities arising from realized and unrealized gains and losses incurred
 in
 the natural gas hedging program of the Company s regulated
 operations. In addition, certain substances used to treat fuel
 emissions are included. 

Deferred
 purchased power costs represent costs that were necessitated by outages at
 two
 of SCE G s base load generating plants in winter 2000-2001. The SCPSC
 approved the recovery of these costs in base rates over a three-year period
 beginning January 2005. 

Environmental
 remediation costs represent costs associated with the assessment and clean-up
 of
 manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites currently or formerly owned by SCE G.
 Costs incurred by SCE G at such sites are being recovered through
 rates. SCE G is authorized to amortize 1.4 million of these
 costs on an annual basis. 

Other
 asset removal costs represent net collections through depreciation rates of
 estimated costs to be incurred for the future removal of assets. 

The
 storm
 damage reserve represents an SCPSC-approved collection through SCE G
 electric rates, capped at 100 million, which can be applied to offset
 incremental storm damage costs in excess of 2.5 million in a calendar year
 and
 certain transmission and distribution insurance premiums. For the nine months
 ended September 30, 2007, 0.7 million was drawn from the
 reserve. If approved,
 rates under such an order would go into effect January 1, 2008. 

In
 an October 1, 2007 order, the SCPSC
 approved SCE G s request to increase the storm damage reserve cap from 50
 million to 100 million. In addition, the SCPSC approved SCE G s
 request to apply certain transmission and distribution insurance premiums
 against the reserve until SCE G files its next retail electric rate
 case. South Carolina Fuel Company, Inc. uses
 commercial paper and a five-year revolving credit facility to finance nuclear
 and fossil fuel inventories and emission allowances. The unused
 portion of these facilities provide commercial paper backup. 

B. Environmental 

In
 March
 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final
 rule known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). CAIR requires the District
 of Columbia and 28 states, including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide
 and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels. SCE G
 has petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
 Circuit to review CAIR. Several other electric utilities have filed separate
 petitions. The petitioners seek a change in the method CAIR uses to allocate
 sulfur dioxide emission allowances to a method the petitioners believe is more
 equitable. The Company believes that installation of additional air quality
 controls will be needed to meet the CAIR requirements, although compliance
 plans and costs to comply with the rule have not been determined. Such costs
 will be material and are expected to be recoverable through rates. 

In
 March
 2005, the EPA issued a final rule establishing a mercury emissions cap and
 trade
 program for coal-fired power plants that requires limits to be met in two
 phases, in 2010 and 2018. Although the Company expects to be able to meet
 the Phase I limits through those measures it already will be taking to
 meet its CAIR obligations, it is uncertain as to how the Phase II limits will
 be
 met. Assuming Phase II limits remain unchanged, installation of additional
 air
 quality controls likely will be required to comply with the rule s Phase II
 mercury emission caps. Final compliance plans and costs to comply with the
 rule
 are still under review. Any
 cost
 allocated to SCE G arising from the remediation of this site, net of
 insurance recoveries, if any, is expected to be recoverable through
 rates. 

SCE G
 maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate its
 current and former MGP sites that could require environmental clean-up. As
 site
 assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures,
 if
 any, deemed necessary to investigate and remediate each site. 

SCE G
 owns three other decommissioned MGP sites in South Carolina which contain
 residues of by-product chemicals. One of the sites has been remediated and
 will
 undergo routine monitoring until released by the South Carolina Department
 of
 Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). The other sites are currently being
 investigated under work plans approved by DHEC. 

The
 Company s
 cash requirements arise primarily from its operational needs, funding its
 construction programs and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of the
 Company to replace existing plant investment, to expand to meet future demand
 for electricity and gas and to install equipment necessary to comply with
 environmental regulations will depend upon its ability to attract the necessary
 financial capital on reasonable terms. SCE G recovers the costs of providing
 services through rates charged to customers. The COL application,
 which
 is expected to be completed and filed before the end of 2007, would be reviewed
 by the NRC for an estimated three years. While SCE G s current plans are to
 pursue the development of one or both of these nuclear units, these plans will
 continue to be influenced by many factors, including NRC licensing attainment,
 ongoing evaluation of relative construction and operating costs, the cost of
 competing fuels, regulatory and environmental requirements and financial market
 conditions. 

In
 May 2007, the Base Load Review Act
 (the Act) became law in South Carolina.

ENVIRONMENTAL
 AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

The
 EPA
 has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative and the United States
 Department of Justice (DOJ) has brought suit against a number of utilities
 in
 federal court alleging violations of the Clean Air Act (CAA). At least two
 of
 these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions
 decided neither favorable to the industry. The Company has analyzed each
 of
 the
 activities covered by the EPA s requests and believes each of these activities
 is covered by the exemption for routine repair, replacement and maintenance
 under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the
 contested revised regulation. The regulations also provide an exemption for
 an
 increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production
 rate and from demand growth. 

The
 current state of continued DOJ enforcement actions continues to be the subject
 of industry-wide speculation, but it is possible that the EPA will commence
 enforcement actions against SCE G and GENCO, and the EPA has the authority
 to seek penalties at the rate of up to 27,500 per day for each violation.
 The
 EPA also could seek installation of BACT (or equivalent) at the three plants.
 The Company continues to believe that any enforcement actions relative to the
 Company s compliance with the CAA would be without merit. To meet compliance
 requirements for the years 2012 through 2016, the Company anticipates additional
 capital expenditures totaling approximately 480 million.

Key
earnings drivers for the Company over the next five years will be additions to
rate base at South Carolina Electric Gas Company
(SCE G), Carolina Gas Transmission Corporation (CGTC) and Public
Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated (PSNC Energy), consisting
primarily of capital expenditures for environmental facilities, new generating
capacity and system expansion. Other factors that will impact future earnings
growth include the regulatory environment, customer growth in each of the
regulated utility businesses, consistent earnings in the natural gas marketing
business in Georgia and controlling the growth of operation and maintenance
expenses. GENCO owns a coal-fired generation
station and sells electricity solely to SCE G. Fuel Company acquires, owns
and provides financing for SCE G s nuclear fuel, fossil fuel and emission
allowance requirements. 

Operating
results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for
electricity, the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to
customers. SCE G s allowed return on equity may not exceed 11.0 ,
with rates set at 10.7 . Demand for electricity is primarily affected by
weather, customer growth and the economy. SCE G is able to recover the
cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers' bills, but
increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and, therefore, the competitive
position of electricity against other energy sources. The
Company cannot predict when or if FERC will advance other regulatory initiatives
related to the national energy market or what conditions such initiatives would
impose on utilities. 

New
legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce
emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury. It is also possible
that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gas emissions. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation
will be enacted, and if it is, the conditions it would impose on
utilities. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory
return on equity. 

Demand
for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy
and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of
alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil
to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of
residential and small commercial customers. As a
result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural
gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions
or other factors, will affect price and impact the Company s ability to retain
large commercial and industrial customers. Significant supply disruptions
occurred in September and October 2005 as a result of hurricane activity in the
Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the curtailment during the period of most large
commercial and industrial customers with interruptible supply agreements. While
supply disruptions were not experienced in 2007 or 2006, the price of natural
gas remains volatile and has resulted in short-term competitive pressure. These increases were
 offset by lower off-system sales of 10.2
 million. 

2006 vs 2005 

Margin
 decreased by 20.8 million due to unfavorable weather, by 16.0 million
 due to decreased off-system sales and by 6.5 million due to lower
 industrial sales. These decreases were offset by residential and
 commercial customer growth of 26.5 million.

 offset by higher average retail prices arising from higher commodity gas
 costs. Net income increased primarily due to decreased bad debt of 9.0
 million and lower operating and customer service expenses of 6.2 million,
 partially offset by a margin decrease of 9.1 million, net of
 taxes. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Cash
requirements for SCANA s regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their
operational needs, funding their construction programs and payment of dividends
to SCANA. The ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant
investment, to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to
install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations, will
depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable
terms. Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through
rates charged to customers. SCE G is uncertain if or when a COL would be submitted to the
NRC. While SCE G s current plans are to pursue the development of
one or both of these nuclear units, these plans will continue to be influenced
by many factors, including NRC licensing attainment, ongoing evaluation of
relative construction and operating costs, the cost of competing fuels,
regulatory and environmental requirements and financial market
conditions. 

In May
2007, the Base Load Review Act (the Act) became law in South
Carolina. The new dividend is
payable April 1, 2008 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2008. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

The Company s regulated
operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal and state
authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic
substances and hazardous and solid wastes. Applicable statutes and
rules include the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA), the Clean Air Interstate Rule
(CAIR), the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), the Clean Water Act, the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Nuclear Waste Act) and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), among
others. Compliance with these environmental requirements involves
significant capital and operating costs, which the Company expects to recover
through existing ratemaking provisions. 

Table of Contents 

For the
three years ended December 31, 2007, the Company s capital expenditures for
environmental control totaled 261.3 million. These expenditures were in
addition to environmental expenditures included in Other operation and
maintenance expenses, which were 34.4 million during 2007, 28.7 million
during 2006, and 25.2 million during 2005. It is not possible to
estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for
capitalized environmental expenditures for the Company are 280.2 million for
2008 and 306.6 million for the four-year period 2009-2012. These expenditures
are included in the Company s Estimated Capital Expenditures table, discussed in
Liquidity and Capital Resources, and include the matters discussed
below. 

In
addition, the Company is monitoring federal legislative proposals that, among
other things, may require significant reductions in carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gas emissions widely believed to contribute to global climate
change. Such legislation could impose a tax based on the carbon
content of primary fossil fuels used by the Company, such as coal and natural
gas. Other proposals call for implementation of a cap and trade
program as a means of meeting stringent new emissions standards. A
national mandatory renewable portfolio standard (RPS) may also be
considered. Under an RPS, electric utilities would be required to
generate a specific percentage of their power from sources deemed to be
 climate-friendly, such as solar, wind, geothermal and agricultural waste, over
varying periods of time. The Company cannot predict the outcome of
these proposals. 

At the state level, no
significant environmental legislation that would affect the Company s operations
advanced during 2007. The Company cannot predict whether such
legislation will be introduced or enacted in 2008, or if new regulations or
changes to existing regulations at the state or federal level will be
implemented in the coming year. 

Air
Quality 

The
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued CAIR as a final rule
in 2005 known as CAIR. CAIR requires the District of Columbia and 28 states,
including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions
in order to attain mandated state levels. CAIR sets emission limits to be met in
two phases beginning in 2009 and 2015, respectively, for nitrogen oxide and
beginning in 2010 and 2015, respectively, for sulfur
dioxide. Numerous states, environmental organizations, industry
groups and individual companies have challenged the rule, seeking a change in
the method CAIR uses to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances. The Company
believes that installation of additional air quality controls will be needed to
meet the CAIR requirements. Although compliance plans and costs to
comply with the rule have not been determined, it is believed that such costs
will be material and will be recoverable through rates. 

The EPA
issued a final rule referred to as CAMR in 2005 establishing a mercury emissions
cap and trade program for coal-fired power plants that required limits to be met
in two phases, in 2010 and 2018. Numerous parties challenged the rule. The Company has
analyzed each of the activities covered by the EPA s requests and believes each
of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair, replacement
and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior
regulation and the contested revised regulation. The regulations also provide an
exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of
operation or production rate and from demand growth. 

The
current state of continued DOJ enforcement actions is the subject of
industry-wide speculation, but it is possible that the EPA will commence
enforcement actions against SCE G and GENCO, and the EPA has the authority
to seek penalties at the rate of up to 32,500 per day for each violation. In addition, the states of South Carolina and North Carolina have
similar laws. The Company maintains an environmental assessment
program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could
require environmental clean-up. In addition, regulators from the EPA and other
federal or state agencies periodically notify the Company that it may be
required to perform or participate in the investigation and remediation of a
hazardous waste site. 

Gas
Distribution 

SCE G
is responsible for four decommissioned manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites
in South Carolina which contain residues of by-product
chemicals. These sites are in various stages of investigation,
remediation and monitoring under work plans approved by the South Carolina
Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). SCE G
anticipates that major remediation activities at these sites will continue until
2012 and will cost an additional 11.9 million. At December 31, 2007, deferred amounts, net of amounts
previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled
 16.7 million. 

PSNC
Energy is responsible for environmental clean-up at five sites in North Carolina
on which MGP residuals are present or suspected. PSNC Energy's actual
remediation costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors, such as
actual site conditions, third-party claims and recoveries from other PRPs. 

South
Carolina Electric Gas Company 

SCE G
is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to retail electric and gas rates,
service, accounting, issuance of securities (other than short-term borrowings)
and other matters. 

In May
2007, the law was changed to revise the statutory definition of fuel costs to
include certain variable environmental costs such as ammonia, lime, limestone
and catalysts consumed in reducing or treating emissions. The revised
definition also includes the cost of emission allowances used for sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury and particulates. 

The
Natural Gas Rate Stabilization Act of 2005 allows natural gas distribution
companies to request annual adjustments to rates to reflect changes in revenues
and expenses and changes in investment. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results
of operations, liquidity or financial position of the Company s Electric
Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write-off would be
recorded. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a
description of the Company s regulatory assets and liabilities, including those
associated with the Company s environmental assessment program. 

The
Company s generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in
a deregulated electric market. Such
unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to
customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. Such unbilled
revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effects
of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the
impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures. The accrual of
unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs.
Accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of 175.5 million at
December 31, 2007 and 177.6 million at December 31, 2006, compared to
total revenues for each year 2007 and 2006 of 4.6 billion. 

Nuclear
Decommissioning 

Accounting
for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant
estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the
factors that could change SCE G s accounting estimates related to
decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and
environmental remediation requirements, and changes in financial assumptions
such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. Changes in any of these
estimates could significantly impact the Company s financial position and cash
flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings-neutral, because
these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers).

return on equity. 

Demand
for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy
and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of
alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil
to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of
residential and small commercial customers. As a
result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural
gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions
or other factors, will affect price and impact the Company s ability to retain
large commercial and industrial customers. Significant supply disruptions
occurred in September and October 2005 as a result of hurricane activity in the
Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the curtailment during the period of most large
commercial and industrial customers with interruptible supply agreements. While
supply disruptions were not experienced in 2007 or 2006, the price of natural
gas remains volatile and has resulted in short-term competitive pressure. These increases were
 offset by lower off-system sales of 10.2
 million. 

2006 vs 2005 

Margin
 decreased by 20.8 million due to unfavorable weather, by 16.0 million
 due to decreased off-system sales and by 6.5 million due to lower
 industrial sales. These decreases were offset by residential and
 commercial customer growth of 26.5 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Cash
requirements for SCANA s regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their
operational needs, funding their construction programs and payment of dividends
to SCANA. The ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant
investment, to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to
install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations, will
depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable
terms. Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through
rates charged to customers. SCE G is uncertain if or when a COL would be submitted to the
NRC. While SCE G s current plans are to pursue the development of
one or both of these nuclear units, these plans will continue to be influenced
by many factors, including NRC licensing attainment, ongoing evaluation of
relative construction and operating costs, the cost of competing fuels,
regulatory and environmental requirements and financial market
conditions. 

In May
2007, the Base Load Review Act (the Act) became law in South
Carolina. The new dividend is
payable April 1, 2008 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2008. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

The Company s regulated
operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal and state
authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic
substances and hazardous and solid wastes. Applicable statutes and
rules include the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA), the Clean Air Interstate Rule
(CAIR), the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), the Clean Water Act, the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Nuclear Waste Act) and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), among
others. Compliance with these environmental requirements involves
significant capital and operating costs, which the Company expects to recover
through existing ratemaking provisions. 

Table of Contents 

For the
three years ended December 31, 2007, the Company s capital expenditures for
environmental control totaled 261.3 million. These expenditures were in
addition to environmental expenditures included in Other operation and
maintenance expenses, which were 34.4 million during 2007, 28.7 million
during 2006, and 25.2 million during 2005. It is not possible to
estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for
capitalized environmental expenditures for the Company are 280.2 million for
2008 and 306.6 million for the four-year period 2009-2012. These expenditures
are included in the Company s Estimated Capital Expenditures table, discussed in
Liquidity and Capital Resources, and include the matters discussed
below. 

In
addition, the Company is monitoring federal legislative proposals that, among
other things, may require significant reductions in carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gas emissions widely believed to contribute to global climate
change. Such legislation could impose a tax based on the carbon
content of primary fossil fuels used by the Company, such as coal and natural
gas. Other proposals call for implementation of a cap and trade
program as a means of meeting stringent new emissions standards. A
national mandatory renewable portfolio standard (RPS) may also be
considered. Under an RPS, electric utilities would be required to
generate a specific percentage of their power from sources deemed to be
 climate-friendly, such as solar, wind, geothermal and agricultural waste, over
varying periods of time. The Company cannot predict the outcome of
these proposals. 

At the state level, no
significant environmental legislation that would affect the Company s operations
advanced during 2007. The Company cannot predict whether such
legislation will be introduced or enacted in 2008, or if new regulations or
changes to existing regulations at the state or federal level will be
implemented in the coming year. 

Air
Quality 

The
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued CAIR as a final rule
in 2005 known as CAIR. CAIR requires the District of Columbia and 28 states,
including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions
in order to attain mandated state levels. CAIR sets emission limits to be met in
two phases beginning in 2009 and 2015, respectively, for nitrogen oxide and
beginning in 2010 and 2015, respectively, for sulfur
dioxide. Numerous states, environmental organizations, industry
groups and individual companies have challenged the rule, seeking a change in
the method CAIR uses to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances. The Company
believes that installation of additional air quality controls will be needed to
meet the CAIR requirements. Although compliance plans and costs to
comply with the rule have not been determined, it is believed that such costs
will be material and will be recoverable through rates. 

The EPA
issued a final rule referred to as CAMR in 2005 establishing a mercury emissions
cap and trade program for coal-fired power plants that required limits to be met
in two phases, in 2010 and 2018. Numerous parties challenged the rule. The Company has
analyzed each of the activities covered by the EPA s requests and believes each
of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair, replacement
and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior
regulation and the contested revised regulation. The regulations also provide an
exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of
operation or production rate and from demand growth. 

The
current state of continued DOJ enforcement actions is the subject of
industry-wide speculation, but it is possible that the EPA will commence
enforcement actions against SCE G and GENCO, and the EPA has the authority
to seek penalties at the rate of up to 32,500 per day for each violation. In addition, the states of South Carolina and North Carolina have
similar laws. The Company maintains an environmental assessment
program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could
require environmental clean-up. In addition, regulators from the EPA and other
federal or state agencies periodically notify the Company that it may be
required to perform or participate in the investigation and remediation of a
hazardous waste site. 

Gas
Distribution 

SCE G
is responsible for four decommissioned manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites
in South Carolina which contain residues of by-product
chemicals. These sites are in various stages of investigation,
remediation and monitoring under work plans approved by the South Carolina
Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). SCE G
anticipates that major remediation activities at these sites will continue until
2012 and will cost an additional 11.9 million. At December 31, 2007, deferred amounts, net of amounts
previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled
 16.7 million. 

PSNC
Energy is responsible for environmental clean-up at five sites in North Carolina
on which MGP residuals are present or suspected. PSNC Energy's actual
remediation costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors, such as
actual site conditions, third-party claims and recoveries from other PRPs. 

South
Carolina Electric Gas Company 

SCE G
is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to retail electric and gas rates,
service, accounting, issuance of securities (other than short-term borrowings)
and other matters. 

In May
2007, the law was changed to revise the statutory definition of fuel costs to
include certain variable environmental costs such as ammonia, lime, limestone
and catalysts consumed in reducing or treating emissions. The revised
definition also includes the cost of emission allowances used for sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury and particulates. 

The
Natural Gas Rate Stabilization Act of 2005 allows natural gas distribution
companies to request annual adjustments to rates to reflect changes in revenues
and expenses and changes in investment. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results
of operations, liquidity or financial position of the Company s Electric
Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write-off would be
recorded. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a
description of the Company s regulatory assets and liabilities, including those
associated with the Company s environmental assessment program. 

The
Company s generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in
a deregulated electric market. Such
unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to
customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. Such unbilled
revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effects
of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the
impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures. The accrual of
unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs.
Accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of 175.5 million at
December 31, 2007 and 177.6 million at December 31, 2006, compared to
total revenues for each year 2007 and 2006 of 4.6 billion. 

Nuclear
Decommissioning 

Accounting
for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant
estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the
factors that could change SCE G s accounting estimates related to
decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and
environmental remediation requirements, and changes in financial assumptions
such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. Changes in any of these
estimates could significantly impact the Company s financial position and cash
flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings-neutral, because
these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers). Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in .

Key
earnings drivers for the Company over the next five years will be additions to
rate base at South Carolina Electric Gas Company
(SCE G), Carolina Gas Transmission Corporation (CGTC) and Public
Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated (PSNC Energy), consisting
primarily of capital expenditures for environmental facilities, new generating
capacity and system expansion. Other factors that will impact future earnings
growth include the regulatory environment, customer growth in each of the
regulated utility businesses, consistent earnings in the natural gas marketing
business in Georgia and controlling the growth of operation and maintenance
expenses. GENCO owns a coal-fired generation
station and sells electricity solely to SCE G. Fuel Company acquires, owns
and provides financing for SCE G s nuclear fuel, fossil fuel and emission
allowance requirements. 

Operating
results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for
electricity, the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to
customers. SCE G s allowed return on equity may not exceed 11.0 ,
with rates set at 10.7 . Demand for electricity is primarily affected by
weather, customer growth and the economy. SCE G is able to recover the
cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers' bills, but
increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and, therefore, the competitive
position of electricity against other energy sources. The
Company cannot predict when or if FERC will advance other regulatory initiatives
related to the national energy market or what conditions such initiatives would
impose on utilities. 

New
legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce
emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury. It is also possible
that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gas emissions. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation
will be enacted, and if it is, the conditions it would impose on
utilities. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory
return on equity. 

Demand
for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy
and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of
alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil
to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of
residential and small commercial customers. As a
result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural
gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions
or other factors, will affect price and impact the Company s ability to retain
large commercial and industrial customers. Significant supply disruptions
occurred in September and October 2005 as a result of hurricane activity in the
Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the curtailment during the period of most large
commercial and industrial customers with interruptible supply agreements. While
supply disruptions were not experienced in 2007 or 2006, the price of natural
gas remains volatile and has resulted in short-term competitive pressure. These increases were
 offset by lower off-system sales of 10.2
 million. 

2006 vs 2005 

Margin
 decreased by 20.8 million due to unfavorable weather, by 16.0 million
 due to decreased off-system sales and by 6.5 million due to lower
 industrial sales. These decreases were offset by residential and

growth include the regulatory environment, customer growth in each of the
regulated utility businesses, consistent earnings in the natural gas marketing
business in Georgia and controlling the growth of operation and maintenance
expenses. GENCO owns a coal-fired generation
station and sells electricity solely to SCE G. Fuel Company acquires, owns
and provides financing for SCE G s nuclear fuel, fossil fuel and emission
allowance requirements. 

Operating
results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for
electricity, the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to
customers. SCE G s allowed return on equity may not exceed 11.0 ,
with rates set at 10.7 . Demand for electricity is primarily affected by
weather, customer growth and the economy. SCE G is able to recover the
cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers' bills, but
increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and, therefore, the competitive
position of electricity against other energy sources. The
Company cannot predict when or if FERC will advance other regulatory initiatives
related to the national energy market or what conditions such initiatives would
impose on utilities. 

New
legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce
emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury. It is also possible
that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gas emissions. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation
will be enacted, and if it is, the conditions it would impose on
utilities. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory
return on equity. 

Demand
for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy
and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of
alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil
to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of
residential and small commercial customers. As a
result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural
gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions
or other factors, will affect price and impact the Company s ability to retain
large commercial and industrial customers. Significant supply disruptions
occurred in September and October 2005 as a result of hurricane activity in the
Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the curtailment during the period of most large
commercial and industrial customers with interruptible supply agreements. While
supply disruptions were not experienced in 2007 or 2006, the price of natural
gas remains volatile and has resulted in short-term competitive pressure. These increases were
 offset by lower off-system sales of 10.2
 million. 

2006 vs 2005 

Margin
 decreased by 20.8 million due to unfavorable weather, by 16.0 million
 due to decreased off-system sales and by 6.5 million due to lower
 industrial sales. These decreases were offset by residential and
 commercial customer growth of 26.5 million.

 partially offset by a margin decrease of 9.1 million, net of
 taxes. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Cash
requirements for SCANA s regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their
operational needs, funding their construction programs and payment of dividends
to SCANA. The ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant
investment, to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to
install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations, will
depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable
terms. Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through
rates charged to customers. SCE G is uncertain if or when a COL would be submitted to the
NRC. While SCE G s current plans are to pursue the development of
one or both of these nuclear units, these plans will continue to be influenced
by many factors, including NRC licensing attainment, ongoing evaluation of
relative construction and operating costs, the cost of competing fuels,
regulatory and environmental requirements and financial market
conditions. 

In May
2007, the Base Load Review Act (the Act) became law in South
Carolina. The new dividend is
payable April 1, 2008 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2008. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

The Company s regulated
operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal and state
authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic
substances and hazardous and solid wastes. Applicable statutes and
rules include the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA), the Clean Air Interstate Rule
(CAIR), the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), the Clean Water Act, the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Nuclear Waste Act) and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), among
others. Compliance with these environmental requirements involves
significant capital and operating costs, which the Company expects to recover
through existing ratemaking provisions. 

Table of Contents 

For the
three years ended December 31, 2007, the Company s capital expenditures for
environmental control totaled 261.3 million. These expenditures were in
addition to environmental expenditures included in Other operation and
maintenance expenses, which were 34.4 million during 2007, 28.7 million
during 2006, and 25.2 million during 2005. It is not possible to
estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for
capitalized environmental expenditures for the Company are 280.2 million for
2008 and 306.6 million for the four-year period 2009-2012. These expenditures
are included in the Company s Estimated Capital Expenditures table, discussed in
Liquidity and Capital Resources, and include the matters discussed
below. 

In
addition, the Company is monitoring federal legislative proposals that, among
other things, may require significant reductions in carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gas emissions widely believed to contribute to global climate
change. Such legislation could impose a tax based on the carbon
content of primary fossil fuels used by the Company, such as coal and natural
gas. Other proposals call for implementation of a cap and trade
program as a means of meeting stringent new emissions standards. A
national mandatory renewable portfolio standard (RPS) may also be
considered. Under an RPS, electric utilities would be required to
generate a specific percentage of their power from sources deemed to be
 climate-friendly, such as solar, wind, geothermal and agricultural waste, over
varying periods of time. The Company cannot predict the outcome of
these proposals. 

At the state level, no
significant environmental legislation that would affect the Company s operations
advanced during 2007. The Company cannot predict whether such
legislation will be introduced or enacted in 2008, or if new regulations or
changes to existing regulations at the state or federal level will be
implemented in the coming year. 

Air
Quality 

The
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued CAIR as a final rule
in 2005 known as CAIR. CAIR requires the District of Columbia and 28 states,
including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions
in order to attain mandated state levels. CAIR sets emission limits to be met in
two phases beginning in 2009 and 2015, respectively, for nitrogen oxide and
beginning in 2010 and 2015, respectively, for sulfur
dioxide. Numerous states, environmental organizations, industry
groups and individual companies have challenged the rule, seeking a change in
the method CAIR uses to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances. The Company
believes that installation of additional air quality controls will be needed to
meet the CAIR requirements. Although compliance plans and costs to
comply with the rule have not been determined, it is believed that such costs
will be material and will be recoverable through rates. 

The EPA
issued a final rule referred to as CAMR in 2005 establishing a mercury emissions
cap and trade program for coal-fired power plants that required limits to be met
in two phases, in 2010 and 2018. Numerous parties challenged the rule. The Company has
analyzed each of the activities covered by the EPA s requests and believes each
of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair, replacement
and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior
regulation and the contested revised regulation. The regulations also provide an
exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of
operation or production rate and from demand growth. 

The
current state of continued DOJ enforcement actions is the subject of
industry-wide speculation, but it is possible that the EPA will commence
enforcement actions against SCE G and GENCO, and the EPA has the authority
to seek penalties at the rate of up to 32,500 per day for each violation. In addition, the states of South Carolina and North Carolina have
similar laws. The Company maintains an environmental assessment
program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could
require environmental clean-up. In addition, regulators from the EPA and other
federal or state agencies periodically notify the Company that it may be
required to perform or participate in the investigation and remediation of a
hazardous waste site. 

Gas
Distribution 

SCE G
is responsible for four decommissioned manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites
in South Carolina which contain residues of by-product
chemicals. These sites are in various stages of investigation,
remediation and monitoring under work plans approved by the South Carolina
Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). SCE G
anticipates that major remediation activities at these sites will continue until
2012 and will cost an additional 11.9 million. At December 31, 2007, deferred amounts, net of amounts
previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled
 16.7 million. 

PSNC
Energy is responsible for environmental clean-up at five sites in North Carolina
on which MGP residuals are present or suspected. PSNC Energy's actual
remediation costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors, such as
actual site conditions, third-party claims and recoveries from other PRPs. 

South
Carolina Electric Gas Company 

SCE G
is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to retail electric and gas rates,
service, accounting, issuance of securities (other than short-term borrowings)
and other matters. 

In May
2007, the law was changed to revise the statutory definition of fuel costs to
include certain variable environmental costs such as ammonia, lime, limestone
and catalysts consumed in reducing or treating emissions. The revised
definition also includes the cost of emission allowances used for sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury and particulates. 

The
Natural Gas Rate Stabilization Act of 2005 allows natural gas distribution
companies to request annual adjustments to rates to reflect changes in revenues
and expenses and changes in investment. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results
of operations, liquidity or financial position of the Company s Electric
Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write-off would be
recorded. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a
description of the Company s regulatory assets and liabilities, including those
associated with the Company s environmental assessment program. 

The
Company s generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in
a deregulated electric market. Such
unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to
customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. Such unbilled
revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effects
of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the
impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures. The accrual of
unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs.
Accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of 175.5 million at
December 31, 2007 and 177.6 million at December 31, 2006, compared to
total revenues for each year 2007 and 2006 of 4.6 billion. 

Nuclear
Decommissioning 

Accounting
for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant
estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the
factors that could change SCE G s accounting estimates related to
decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and
environmental remediation requirements, and changes in financial assumptions
such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. Changes in any of these
estimates could significantly impact the Company s financial position and cash
flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings-neutral, because
these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers). Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in .

Key
earnings drivers for SCE G over the next five years will be additions to
utility rate base, consisting primarily of capital expenditures for
environmental facilities, new generating capacity and system expansion. Other
factors that will impact future earnings growth include the regulatory
environment, customer growth and controlling the growth of operation and
maintenance expenses. At
December 31, 2007 SCE G provided electricity to 639,300 customers.
GENCO owns a coal-fired generation station and sells electricity solely to
SCE G. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for SCE G s
nuclear fuel, fossil fuel and emission allowance requirements. Both GENCO and
Fuel Company are consolidated with SCE G for financial reporting
purposes. In January 2005, as a result of an electric rate case,
SCE G s allowed return on equity may not exceed 11.0 , with rates set at
10.7 . Demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather, customer growth
and the economy. SCE G is able to recover the cost of fuel used in electric
generation through retail customers bills, but increases in fuel costs affect
electric prices and, therefore, the competitive position of electricity against
other energy sources. The Company cannot predict when or if FERC will advance
other regulatory initiatives related to the national energy market or what
conditions such initiatives would impose on utilities. 

New
legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce
emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury. It is also possible
that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The
Company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted, and if it is,
the conditions it would impose on utilities. Embedded
in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity.
This allowed return on equity is 10.25 . 

Demand
for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy
and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of
alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil
to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of
residential and small commercial customers. As a
result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural
gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions
or other factors, will affect price and impact SCE G s ability to retain
large commercial and industrial customers. Significant supply disruptions did
occur in September and October 2005 as a result of hurricane activity in the
Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the curtailment during the period of most large
commercial and industrial customers with interruptible supply agreements. While
supply disruptions were not experienced in 2007 or in 2006, the price of natural
gas remains volatile and has resulted in short-term competitive pressure. These increases were offset
 by lower off-system sales of 10.2
 million.

bills, but increases in gas costs affect total retail prices and, therefore, the
competitive position of gas relative to electricity and other forms of energy.
Increases in gas costs may also result in lower usage by customers unable to
switch to alternate fuels. 

Additionally, the Company and SCE G
anticipate significant capital expenditures for environmental compliance and
baseload generation in order to meet future usage demands. The cost
of additional baseload generation may be affected by the choice of technology or
fuel related to such generation, each of which may be driven by environmental
and other non-economic factors. The completion of these projects
within established budgets and timeframes is contingent upon many variables
including the obtaining of permits and licenses in a timely manner and our
timely securing of labor and materials at estimated costs. Also, higher worldwide demand for copper, which we use in our
transmission and distribution lines, has led to significant price
increases. Our ability to maintain our operations or to complete
construction projects and new baseload generation (whether based on nuclear or
another form of generation) at reasonable cost, if at all, could be adversely
affected by increases in worldwide demand for key parts or commodities,
increases in the price of or the unavailability of labor, commodities or other
materials, increases in lead times for components, increased environmental
pressures, a failure in the supply chain (whether resulting from the foregoing
or other factors) or delays in licensing, siting, design, financing or
construction. To the extent that delays occur or cost overages are
not recoverable, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition
may be diminished. 

The
Company and SCE G do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities.
This could result in increased costs, thereby resulting in lower margins and
adversely affecting results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition. 

The
Company and SCE G attempt to manage commodity price exposure by establishing
risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions (i.e.,
to hedge our exposure to demand, market effects of weather and other changes in
commodity prices). We do not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from
commodity price volatility. Although we believe we have constructive relationships with our
regulators, our ability to obtain rate increases that will allow us to maintain
reasonable rates of return is dependent upon regulatory discretion, and there
can be no assurance that we will be able to implement rate increases when
sought. 

The
Company and SCE G are subject to extensive federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations including air emissions (such as reducing
nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions, or potential future
control of greenhouse gas emissions). Compliance with these laws and
regulations requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental
monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and
permits at our facilities. These expenditures have been significant in the past
and are expected to increase in the future. Changes in compliance requirements
or a more burdensome interpretation by governmental authorities of existing
requirements may impose additional costs on us or require us to curtail some of
our activities. Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could harm
our industry, our business and our results of operations and financial position,
especially if emission or discharge limits are reduced, more extensive
permitting requirements are imposed or additional regulatory requirements are
imposed. 

The
Company and SCE G are vulnerable to interest rate increases which would
increase our borrowing costs, and may not have access to capital at favorable
rates, if at all, both of which may adversely affect results of operations, cash
flows and financial condition. If these short-term ratings were to decline, it could
significantly limit access to the commercial paper market and other sources of
liquidity. 

Operating
results may be adversely affected by abnormal weather. 

The
Company and SCE G have historically sold less power, delivered less gas and
received lower prices for natural gas in deregulated markets, and consequently
earned less income, when weather conditions have been milder than normal. Mild
weather in the future could diminish the revenues and results of operations and
harm the financial condition of the Company and SCE G. In addition, severe
weather can be destructive, causing outages and property damage, adversely
affecting operating expenses and revenues. 

Table of Contents 

Potential
competitive changes may adversely affect our gas and electricity businesses due
to the loss of customers, reductions in revenues, or write-down of stranded
assets. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue
streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for
recovery of the resulting stranded costs, a write-down in the value of the
related assets would be required. 

The
Company and SCE G are subject to risks associated with changes in business
climate which could increase and adversely affect revenues, results of
operations, cash flows and financial condition and could limit access to
capital. 

Sales and
sales growth is dependent upon the economic climate in the service territories
of the Company and SCE G, which may be affected by regional, national or
even international economic factors. Some economic sectors important to our
customer base may be particularly affected. 

Problems
with operations could cause us to curtail or limit our ability to serve
customers or cause us to incur substantial costs, thereby adversely impacting
revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition. 

Critical
processes or systems in the Company s or SCE G s operations could become
impaired or fail from a variety of causes, such as equipment breakdown,
transmission line failure, information systems failure or security breach, the
effects of drought (including reduced water levels) on the operation of emission
control or other generation equipment, and the effects of a pandemic or
terrorist attack on our workforce or on the ability of vendors and suppliers to
maintain services key to our operations. 

In
particular, as the operator of power generation facilities, SCE G could
incur problems such as the breakdown or failure of power generation or emission
control equipment, transmission lines, other equipment or processes which would
result in performance below assumed levels of output or efficiency. In addition,
any such breakdown or failure may result in SCE G purchasing replacement
power at market rates, if such replacement power is available at all. Such a decline
in value could limit our ability to raise debt and equity capital. 

A
significant portion of SCE G's generating capacity is derived from nuclear
power, the use of which exposes us to regulatory, environmental and business
risks. These risks could increase our costs or otherwise constrain our business,
thereby adversely impacting our results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition. 

From time
to time, the Company and SCE G make strategic decisions that may impact our
direction with regard to business opportunities, the services and technologies
offered to customers or that are used to serve customers, and the generating
plant and other infrastructure that form the basis of much of our business.
These strategic decisions may not result in a return of or on our invested
capital, and the effects of these strategic decisions may have long-term
implications that are not likely to be known to us in the short-term. Changing
political climates and public attitudes may adversely affect the ongoing
acceptability of strategic decisions that have been made, to the detriment of
the Company or SCE G. Over time, these strategic decisions or
changing attitudes toward such decisions, which could be adverse to the
Company s or SCE G s interests, may have a negative effect on our results of
operations, cash flows and financial position, as well as limit our ability to
access capital.","['Natural gas began the quarter trading in the $13 to $13.50 per decatherm range. Since then prices have fallen steadily and are currently around $6 to $7 per decatherm.\nHurricanes, Gustav and Ike can have done a lot to prevent gas prices from falling further.

"Cash
requirements for the Company s regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their
operational needs, funding their construction programs and payment of dividends
to SCANA. The ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant
investment, to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to
install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations will depend
on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms.
Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates
charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on
historical costs. While seeking authorization from regulators for two
plants and maintaining a position on the schedule for long-lead materials for
two plants, SCE G intends to maintain flexibility, as to the number of
plants to build, through contractual off-ramps up until the final notice to
proceed with construction is granted which SCE G anticipates will be in
2011. 

Table of Contents 

On April
1, 2008, SCE G filed a Letter of Intent with the SCPSC and the South
Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff (ORS) indicating that SCE G plans to
file an application pursuant to the Base Load Review Act (the Act), seeking a
certificate of environmental compatibility and public convenience and necessity
and for a base load review order (Combined Application). Based
on an application filed by the utility under the Act, the SCPSC would review and
rule on the prudency of the decision to build. SCE G expects to file the Combined Application in the
second quarter of 2008. 

ENVIRONMENTAL
AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

The
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule in 2005
known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). CAIR requires the District of
Columbia and 28 states, including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide and
sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state
levels. CAIR sets emission limits to be met in two phases beginning
in 2009 and 2015, respectively, for nitrogen oxide and beginning in 2010 and
2015, respectively, for sulfur dioxide. Numerous states,
environmental organizations, industry groups and individual companies have
challenged the rule, seeking a change in the method CAIR uses to allocate sulfur
dioxide emission allowances. Additional air quality controls will be
needed to meet the CAIR requirements. These costs will be recoverable through rates. 

The EPA
issued a final rule referred to as the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) in 2005
establishing a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal-fired power
plants that required limits to be met in two phases, in 2010 and 2018. Numerous
parties challenged the rule. The Company cannot predict the effect of this ruling on
implementation of CAMR state implementation plans (SIPS) and newly promulgated
CAMR regulations by the states.

Accumulated
deferred income tax liabilities arising from utility operations that have not
been included in customer rates are recorded as a regulatory asset. 
Accumulated deferred income tax assets arising from deferred investment tax
credits are recorded as a regulatory liability. In
addition to fuel and purchased gas, included in these amounts are regulatory
liabilities arising from realized and unrealized gains and losses incurred in
the natural gas hedging program of the Company s regulated
operations. In addition, the cost of emission allowances and certain
reagents used to treat fuel emissions are included. 

Environmental
remediation costs represent costs associated with the assessment and clean-up of
manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites currently or formerly owned by SCE G.
Costs incurred by SCE G at such sites are being recovered through
rates. SCE G is authorized to amortize 1.4 million of these
costs annually. 

Other
asset removal costs represent net collections through depreciation rates of
estimated costs to be incurred for the removal of assets in the
future. 

The storm
damage reserve represents an SCPSC-approved collection through SCE G
electric rates, capped at 100 million, which can be applied to offset
incremental storm damage costs in excess of 2.5 million in a calendar year and
certain transmission and distribution insurance premiums. During the
three months ended March 31, 2008, 0.7 million was drawn from the
reserve. Upon approval from the SCPSC
discussed below, construction could begin shortly thereafter, with a projected
in-service date of 2016 for the first unit. 

Table of Contents 

On April
1, 2008, SCE G filed a Letter of Intent with the SCPSC and the South
Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff (ORS) indicating that SCE G plans to
file an application pursuant to the Base Load Review Act (the Act), seeking a
certificate of environmental compatibility and public convenience and necessity
and for a base load review order (Combined Application). Based on an application
filed by the utility under the Act, the SCPSC would review and rule on the
prudency of the decision to build the plant. No
such additional depreciation has been recognized. 

In
October 2007 the SCPSC approved SCE G s request to increase the storm damage
reserve cap from 50 million to 100 million. In addition, the SCPSC
approved SCE G s request to apply certain transmission and distribution
insurance premiums against the reserve until SCE G files its next retail
electric rate case. 

In May
2007, South Carolina law was changed to revise the statutory definition of fuel
costs to include certain variable environmental costs such as ammonia, lime,
limestone and catalysts consumed in reducing or treating
emissions. The revised definition also includes the cost of emission
allowances used for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury and
particulates. 

SCE G s
rates are established using a cost of fuel component approved by the SCPSC which
may be modified periodically to reflect changes in the price of fuel purchased
by SCE G. 

B. Environmental 

The
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule in 2005
known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). CAIR requires the District of
Columbia and 28 states, including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide and
sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state
levels. CAIR sets emission limits to be met in two phases beginning
in 2009 and 2015, respectively, for nitrogen oxide and beginning in 2010 and
2015, respectively, for sulfur dioxide. Numerous states,
environmental organizations, industry groups and individual companies have
challenged the rule, seeking a change in the method CAIR uses to allocate sulfur
dioxide emission allowances. Additional air quality controls will be needed
to meet the CAIR requirements. These costs will be recoverable through
rates. 

The EPA
issued a final rule referred to as the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) in 2005
establishing a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal-fired power
plants that required limits to be met in two phases, in 2010 and 2018. Numerous
parties challenged the rule. The settlement, which
is subject to court approval, would result in an allocation of cost, net of
insurance recoveries, to SCE G that is not material, and such cost is
expected to be recoverable through rates. 

SCE G
maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate its
current and former operations sites that could require environmental clean-up.
As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of
expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and remediate each site.
These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available;
therefore, actual expenditures could differ significantly from the original
estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and
clean-up relate solely to regulated operations. 

SCE G
is responsible for four decommissioned MGP sites in South
Carolina which contain residues of by-product chemicals. These
sites are in various stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring under
work plans approved by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental
Control. SCE G anticipates that major remediation activities at
these sites will continue until 2012 and will cost an additional 14.2
million. 

The
Company s cash requirements arise primarily from its operational needs, funding
its construction programs and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of the
Company to replace existing plant investment, to expand to meet future demand
for electricity and gas and to install equipment necessary to comply with
environmental regulations will depend upon its ability to attract the necessary
financial capital on reasonable terms. SCE G recovers the costs of providing
services through rates charged to customers. While seeking authorization from regulators for two plants and
maintaining a position on the schedule for long-lead materials for two plants,
SCE G intends to maintain flexibility, as to the number of plants to build,
through contractual off-ramps up until the final notice to proceed with
construction is granted which SCE G anticipates will be in
2011.

and for a base load review order (Combined Application). Based
on an application filed by the utility under the Act, the SCPSC would review and
rule on the prudency of the decision to build. 

The
Company's issuance of various securities, including short- and long-term debt,
is subject to customary approval or authorization by state and federal
regulatory bodies including the SCPSC and FERC.

ENVIRONMENTAL
AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

The
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule in 2005
known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). CAIR requires the District of
Columbia and 28 states, including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide and
sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state
levels. CAIR had set emission limits to be met in two phases
beginning in 2009 and 2015, respectively, for nitrogen oxide and beginning in
2010 and 2015, respectively, for sulfur dioxide. Numerous states,
environmental organizations, industry groups and individual companies challenged
the rule, seeking a change in the method CAIR used to allocate sulfur dioxide
emission allowances. On July 11, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the rule in its entirety and
remanded it to the EPA for further rulemaking. Any costs incurred to comply with this vacated rule or other
rules issued by the EPA in the future are expected to be recoverable through
rates. 

The EPA
issued a final rule referred to as the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) in 2005
establishing a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal-fired power
plants that required limits to be met in two phases, in 2010 and 2018. Numerous
parties challenged the rule. The Company cannot predict the effect of this ruling on
implementation of CAMR state implementation plans (SIP) and newly promulgated
CAMR regulations by the states.

OTHER
MATTERS 

Although
SCANA invests in securities and business ventures, it does not hold investments
in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in
SFAS 140, Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities, or as described in FIN 46(R), Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities. 

The
Company s cash requirements arise primarily from its operational needs, funding
its construction programs and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of the
Company to replace existing plant investment, to expand to meet future demand

We
 do not
 expect seasonality to affect our operations in a materially adverse
 manner. Our results during the second fiscal quarter (the months of
 December, January and February) generally are lower than other quarters because
 of the climate of the locations of a number of Partner and Franchise
 Drive-Ins. 

Critical
 Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 included in this document contain information that is pertinent to management's
 discussion and analysis.","10 

Changes
 in economic, market and other conditions could adversely affect Sonic and its
 franchisees, and thereby Sonic s operating results. 

The
 quick-service restaurant industry
 is affected by changes in economic conditions, consumer preferences and spending
 patterns, demographic trends, consumer perceptions of food safety, weather,
 traffic patterns, the type, number and location of competing restaurants, and
 the effects of war or terrorist activities and any governmental responses
 thereto. Factors such as interest rates, inflation, gasoline prices,
 food costs, labor and benefit costs, legal claims, and the availability of
 management and hourly employees also affect restaurant operations and
 administrative expenses. If customer demand decreases
 rapidly, our results of operations would also decline
 precipitously. These events and factors include: 

variations
 in the timing and volume of Sonic Drive-Ins 
 sales; 

sales
 promotions by Sonic and its
 competitors; 

changes
 in average same-store sales and customer
 visits; 

variations
 in the price, availability and shipping costs of
 supplies; 

seasonal
 effects on demand for Sonic s
 products; 

unexpected
 slowdowns in new drive-in development
 efforts; 

changes
 in competitive and economic conditions
 generally; 

changes
 in the cost or availability of ingredients or
 labor; 

weather
 and other acts of God; and 

changes
 in the number of franchise agreement
 renewals. 

Our
 profitability may be adversely affected by increases in energy
 costs. 

We
 are
 dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet certain
 specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of
 perishable food products may be caused by unanticipated demand, problems in
 production or distribution, financial or other difficulties of suppliers,
 disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other
 conditions. We purchase large quantities of food and supplies, which
 can be subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate
 conditions, industry demand, energy costs, changes in international commodity
 markets and other factors. These shortages or rapid price increases
 could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which
 would likely lower revenues and reduce our profitability. 

We
 plan
 to increase the number of Sonic Drive-Ins, but may not be able to achieve our
 growth objectives, and any new drive-ins may not be profitable. The
 opening and success of drive-ins depends on various factors,
 including: 

competition
 from other restaurants in current and future
 markets; 

the
 degree of saturation in existing
 markets; 

consumer
 interest in the Sonic Brand in new and developing
 markets; 

the
 identification and availability of suitable and economically viable
 locations; 

sales
 levels at existing drive-ins; 

the
 negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new
 locations; 

permitting
 and regulatory compliance; 

the
 cost and availability of construction
 resources; 

the
 ability to meet construction
 schedules; 

the
 availability of qualified franchisees and their financial and other
 development capabilities; 

the
 ability to hire and train qualified management
 personnel; 

weather;
 and 

general
 economic and business conditions. 

If
 we are
 unable to open as many new drive-ins as planned, if the drive-ins are less
 profitable than anticipated or if we are otherwise unable to successfully
 implement our growth strategy, revenue and profitability may grow more slowly
 or
 even decrease. Although management does not anticipate an
 event of default or any other event of noncompliance with the
 provisions
 of the Notes, if such an event occurred, the unpaid amounts outstanding
 could become immediately due and payable. 

12 

Sonic
 Drive-Ins are subject to health, employment, environmental and other government
 regulations, and failure to comply with existing or future government
 regulations could expose us to litigation, damage to our reputation and lower
 profits. 

Sonic
 and
 its franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting
 their businesses. The successful development and operation of
 restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition
 of
 suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use (including the placement
 of drive-thru windows), environmental (including litter), traffic and other
 regulations. Restaurant operations are also subject to licensing and
 regulation by state and local departments relating to health, food preparation,
 sanitation and safety standards, federal and state labor and immigration laws,
 (including applicable minimum wage requirements, overtime, working and safety
 conditions and citizenship requirements), federal and state laws prohibiting
 discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities,
 such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Accordingly,
 we are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real
 estate. In particular, the value of our assets could decrease and our
 costs could increase because of changes in the investment climate for real
 estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of our drive-ins,
 which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area, as
 well
 as liability for environmental conditions. We generally cannot cancel
 the leases, so if an existing or future Sonic Drive-In is not profitable, and
 we
 decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations
 under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent
 for the balance of the lease term. 

Catastrophic
 events may disrupt our business. 

Unforeseen
 events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public
 health issues, and natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or other
 adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States
 or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of franchisees,
 suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic
 instability. These events could reduce demand for our products or
 make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers","['This feature allows the company to de-leverage over time.

Results
 for the third quarter ended May 31, 2008 reflected a number of
 challenges. System-wide same-store sales declined resulting primarily
 from weather-affected sales in March; system-wide performance improved as the

lives could be impacted by such factors as future energy prices, environmental regulations, various legal factors and competition. If the useful lives of these assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation expense may
increase, liabilities for future asset retirement obligations may be insufficient and impairments in carrying values of tangible and intangible assets may result.","Our workers are subject to the normal hazards
associated with providing services at industrial facilities. Even with proper safety precautions, these hazards can lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage to, or destruction of, property, plant and equipment, lower employee morale and
environmental damage. We are intensely focused on maintaining a strong safety environment and reducing the risk of accidents to the lowest possible level. Although we maintain insurance coverage, such coverage may be inadequate
to protect us from all expenses related to these risks. Our operations and properties are subject to extensive governmental
regulation under environmental laws. These laws and regulations can impose substantial sanctions for violations or operational changes that may limit our services. Some of our services involve handling or monitoring highly regulated
materials, including hazardous wastes. Environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for regulated materials and require us to obtain permits and comply with various other requirements. The improper characterization,
handling, disposal or monitoring of regulated materials or any other failure by us to comply with increasingly complex and strictly enforced federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations or associated environmental permits could
subject us to the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, or the issuance of injunctions that could restrict or prevent our ability to operate our business and complete
contracted services. A defect in our services or faulty workmanship could result in an environmental liability if, as a result of the defect or faulty workmanship, a contaminate is released into the environment. We currently maintain liability
insurance with pollution coverage to limit any potential loss, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will fully protect us against a valid claim or loss. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good and
we have had no strikes or work stoppages, no assurances can be made that we will not in the future experience these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees, or our employees generally, or
that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor.

"Any of these
 factors, either alone or taken together, could have a material
 adverse effect on us and could change whether any
 forward-looking statement ultimately turns out to be true.
 Additionally, we assume no obligation to update any
 forward-looking statement as a result of future events,
 circumstances or developments. The following discussion should
 be read together with the Condensed Consolidated Financial
 Statements and the notes thereto.

Some of the risks that we face and that could affect our
 business and financial statements for the remainder of 2006 and
 beyond include:

competition may negatively affect our profitability or cash
 flows, our price increases may have negative effects on volumes,
 and price roll-backs and lower than average pricing to retain
 and attract customers may negatively affect our yield on base
 business;

we may be unable to maintain or expand margins if we are unable
 to control costs;

we may be unable to attract or retain qualified personnel,
 including licensed commercial drivers and truck maintenance
 professionals;

we may not be able to successfully execute or continue our
 operational or other margin improvement plans and programs,
 including pricing increases, passing on increased costs to our
 customers, divesting under-performing assets and purchasing
 accretive businesses, any of which could negatively affect our
 revenues and margins;

fuel price increases or fuel supply shortages may increase our
 expenses, including our tax expense if Section 45K credits
 are phased out due to continued high crude oil prices;

fluctuating commodity prices may have negative effects on our
 operating revenues and expenses;

inflation and resulting higher interest rates may have negative
 effects on the economy, which could result in decreases in
 volumes of waste generated and increases in our financing costs
 and other expenses;

the possible inability of our insurers to meet their obligations
 may cause our expenses to increase;

weather conditions cause our
 quarter-to-quarter 
 results to fluctuate, and extremely harsh weather or natural
 disasters may cause us to temporarily shut down operations;

possible changes in our estimates of site remediation
 requirements, final capping, closure and post-closure
 obligations, compliance and regulatory developments may increase
 our expenses;

regulations may negatively impact our business by, among other
 things, increasing compliance costs and potential liabilities;

if we are unable to obtain and maintain permits needed to open,
 operate
 and/or 
 expand our facilities, our results of operations will be
 negatively impacted;

limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of
 out-of-state 
 or cross-border waste or certain categories of waste can
 increase our expenses and reduce our revenues;

possible charges as a result of shut-down operations,
 uncompleted development or expansion projects or other events
 may negatively affect earnings;

trends requiring recycling or waste reduction at the source and
 prohibiting the disposal of certain types of wastes could have
 negative effects on volumes of waste going to landfills and
 waste-to-energy 
 facilities, which are higher margin businesses than recycling;

efforts by labor unions to organize our employees may divert
 management s attention and increase operating expenses and
 we may be unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining
 agreements with those who have chosen to be represented by
 unions, which could lead to union-initiated work stoppages,
 including strikes, which could adversely affect our results of
 operations and cash flows;

negative outcomes of litigation or threatened litigation or
 governmental proceedings may increase our costs, limit our
 ability to conduct or expand our operations, or limit our
 ability to execute our business plans and strategies;

possible errors or problems implementing and deploying new
 information technology systems may decrease our efficiencies and
 increase our costs to operate;

the adoption of new accounting standards or interpretations may
 cause fluctuations in quarterly results of operations or
 adversely impact our results of operations; and

we may reduce or eliminate our dividend or share repurchase
 program or we may need additional capital if cash flows are less
 than we expect or capital expenditures are more than we expect,
 and we may not be able to obtain any needed capital on
 acceptable terms.

These are not the only risks that we face. Our selling, general and administrative costs as a
 percentage of revenue for the three months ended
 September 30, 2006 increased by 0.8 percentage points,
 largely due to higher bonus expense as a result of the overall
 improvement in our performance. The increase in selling, general
 and administrative expenses is also due to non-capitalizable
 costs incurred to support the development of our revenue
 management system and the increased costs for our national
 advertising campaign, both of which we expect to provide
 long-term benefits to the growth and sustainability of our
 business.

Our net income for the quarter was 300 million, or
 0.55 per diluted share, as compared with
 215 million, or 0.38 per diluted share, in the third
 quarter of 2005. For the nine months ended September 30,
 2006, our net income was 903 million, or 1.65 per
 diluted share, as compared with 892 million, or
 1.57 per diluted share, for the same period in 2005. In some cases, these estimates are particularly
 difficult to determine and we must exercise significant
 judgment. The most difficult, subjective and complex estimates
 and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of
 uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills,
 environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments and
 self-insurance reserves and recoveries, as described in
 Item 7 of our Annual Report on
 Form 10-K 
 for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Operating
 Revenues 

Our operating revenues for the three and nine months ended
 September 30, 2006 were 3.4 billion and
 10.1 billion, respectively, compared with
 3.4 billion and 9.7 billion for the three and nine
 months ended September 30, 2005, respectively. Revenue improvements at our
 waste-to-energy 
 facilities were largely due to significant increases in the
 rates charged for electricity under our long-term contracts with
 electric utilities, which generally are indexed to natural gas
 prices. Base business yield improvements at our transfer
 stations and landfills are due to the improved pricing practices
 implemented as a result of our findings from our landfill
 pricing study during 2005.

Our environmental cost recovery fee increased revenues by
 13 million and 31 million during the three and nine
 months ended September 30, 2006, respectively, when
 compared with the same periods in 2005. Other fee programs
 targeted at recovering the costs we incur for services, such as
 the collection of past due balances, also contributed to yield
 improvement in the current year periods.

Commodity Revenues attributable to recycling
 commodities were flat when comparing the three months ended
 September 30, 2006 with the three months ended
 September 30, 2005, but have decreased significantly when
 comparing the nine-month periods. For
 the nine months ended September 30, 2006, this
 volume-related revenue decline was the most significant in our
 residential collection operations, with our Eastern, Southern
 and Midwestern Groups experiencing the most notable decreases.
 Our commercial and industrial collection operations have also
 experienced volume-related revenue declines in 2006, principally
 in the Eastern and Midwestern Groups.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006,
 increases in the revenue generated from our disposal volumes
 have partially offset the decline in revenue from collection
 volumes. We believe that the continued strength of the economy
 and favorable weather in many parts of the country were the
 primary drivers of the higher disposal volumes, which were
 particularly strong in the Southern Group. The growth in
 revenues from our disposal-related volumes is driven primarily
 from our special waste, municipal solid waste and construction
 and demolition waste streams.

Also contributing to the changes in our volume-related revenues
 for 2006 were (i) an increase in volume-related revenues
 during the first half of 2006 associated with continued
 hurricane related services, (ii) nearly one less workday
 during the third quarter of 2006 when compared with the third
 quarter of 2005, (iii) the deconsolidation of a variable
 interest entity during the second quarter of 2006 and
 (iv) a decline in revenue due to the completion in early
 2006 of the construction of an integrated waste facility on
 behalf of a municipality in Canada. The revenue generated by
 this construction project in 2005 was low margin . In
 addition, these costs have decreased
 year-over-year 
 due to the completion of our construction of an integrated waste
 facility for a municipality in Canada, which had caused a
 substantial increase in these costs during 2005.

Fuel When compared with the corresponding
 prior year periods, we experienced an average increase in the
 cost of fuel of 0.36 per gallon for the three months ended
 September 30, 2006 and 0.46 per gallon for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2006. However, this cost
 increase is offset by our fuel surcharges to customers, which
 are reflected as fuel price increases within our Operating
 Revenues section above.

Other The decline in these costs for the
 three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 is partially
 attributable to the deconsolidation of a variable interest
 entity in April 2006 and insurance recoveries associated with
 Hurricane Katrina. Gains recognized on the sales of assets also
 contributed to the
 year-to-date 
 decline in our other operating costs.

Selling,
 General and Administrative 

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of
 (i) labor costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related
 insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and
 equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which
 include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services;
 (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances
 for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and
 (iv) other general and administrative expenses, which
 include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and
 data telecommunication, advertising, travel and entertainment,
 rentals, postage and printing.

The following table summarizes the major components of our
 selling, general and administrative costs for the three and nine
 months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in

Our labor costs, professional fees and other general and
 administrative costs for the three and nine months ended
 September 30, 2006 increased by an aggregate of
 4 million and 13 million, respectively, due to
 non-capitalizable costs incurred to support the development of
 our revenue management system. In addition, during the third quarter of 2006, we
 recorded impairment charges of 10 million related to
 operations in our Recycling and Southern Groups.

During the second quarter of 2005, we recorded a
 35 million charge for the impairment of the Pottstown
 Landfill located in West Pottsgrove Township, Pennsylvania. We
 determined that an impairment was necessary because, on
 May 18, 2005, the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board
 upheld a denial by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
 Protection of a permit application for a vertical expansion at
 the landfill. After the denial was upheld, the Company reviewed
 the options available at the Pottstown Landfill and the
 likelihood of the possible outcomes of those options.",,"['When you look at -- we talk about Special Waste quite often that Special Waste jobs can be lumpy. What we saw this quarter is that if you exclude the hurricane volumes from last years Special Waste was basically flat. Now, flat Special Waste volumes are down a little bit from what we saw on the previous quarters, but still flat.']",negative,only_Mgm,treatment,11955,0.0,5.0,-0.9999998,negative,0.955968142,0.0,0.0,0.0,60.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"In some
 cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine
 and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our
 financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex
 estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount
 of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills,
 environmental remediation liabilities, asset impairments and
 self-insurance reserves and recoveries, as described below.
 Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and
 assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial
 statements.

Landfills The cost estimates for final
 capping, closure and post-closure activities at landfills for
 which we have responsibility are estimated based on our
 interpretations of current requirements and proposed or
 anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional
 costs, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. Because
 landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations are
 measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques,
 changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping
 and closure and post-closure activities would have an effect on
 these liabilities, related assets and results of operations.

Landfill Costs We estimate the total cost to
 develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted
 and expansion capacity. This estimate includes such costs as
 landfill liner material and installation, excavation for
 airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas
 collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for
 groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering,
 capitalized interest,
 on-site road
 construction and other capital infrastructure costs.
 Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases
 for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property.
 The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on
 future events. The remaining amortizable basis of each landfill
 includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and
 expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and
 capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and
 projections of future purchase and development costs.

Final Capping Costs We estimate the cost for
 each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped
 and the capping materials and activities required. Most significantly, if our belief that we will
 receive an expansion permit changes adversely and it is
 determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be
 considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill
 asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment. If
 it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion
 permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the
 expansion effort are expensed immediately.

Environmental Remediation Liabilities We are
 subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the
 protection of the environment. Under current laws and
 regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage
 caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions
 that existed before we acquired a site. These liabilities
 include potentially responsible party PRP investigations, settlements, certain legal and consultant fees,
 as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and
 clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs
 directly related to the remedy. We provide for expenses
 associated with environmental remediation obligations when such
 amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We
 routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and
 determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on
 several estimates and assumptions.

We estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is
 probable that a liability has been incurred based on
 site-specific facts and circumstances. Next, we review the
 same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed
 PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then
 either developed using our internal resources or by third-party
 environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally
 developed estimates are based on:

Management s judgment and experience in remediating our own
 and unrelated parties sites;

Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of
 remediation;

The number, financial resources and relative degree of
 responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation
 of a specific site; and

The typical allocation of costs among PRPs.

Asset Impairments Our long-lived assets,
 including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our
 financial statements based on their cost less accumulated
 depreciation or amortization. If the carrying values are in excess of
 undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any
 impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset
 group to its carrying value. Fair value is determined by either
 an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis
 of the asset or asset group or an actual third-party valuation.
 If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be
 less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an
 impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the
 period that the impairment indicator occurs.

Typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include:

A significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset
 group;

A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
 asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition;

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
 climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group,
 including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;

An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
 originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a
 long-lived asset;

Current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a
 history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or
 forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the
 use of a long-lived asset or asset group; or

A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived
 asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of
 significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful
 life.

If any of these or other indicators occur, the asset is reviewed
 to determine whether there has been an impairment. Estimating
 future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections
 may vary from cash flows eventually realized. In 2005, our transfer business in the East and
 municipal solid waste landfill disposal operations in the South
 provided the most significant revenue growth from base business
 yield in those lines of our business.

We also experienced substantial yield contributions to revenues
 from our
 waste-to-energy 
 facilities in the second half of 2005 and through the third
 quarter of 2006. The revenue improvements at our
 waste-to-energy 
 facilities were largely due to significant increases in the
 rates charged for electricity under our long-term contracts with
 electric utilities, which generally are indexed to natural gas
 prices.

Our environmental cost recovery fee, which is included in base
 business yield, increased revenues on a
 year-over-year 
 basis by 43 million in 2006 and 33 million in 2005.
 Other fee programs, which were targeted at recovering the costs
 we incur for services that are included in base business yield,
 such as fees for the collection of past due balances, also
 contributed to yield improvement in 2006.

The 2005 revenue improvements attributable to yield discussed
 above were partially offset by a general decline in yield in
 special waste landfill disposal operations, noted principally in
 our Midwest and Southern Groups.

Commodity Our revenues in both 2005 and 2006
 declined as compared with the prior year due to price decreases
 in recycling commodities. Average prices for old corrugated
 cardboard dropped by 8 in both 2005 and 2006, from 85 per
 ton in 2004 to 78 per ton in 2005 and to 72 per ton
 in 2006. Our commercial collection operations also had
 declines in revenue due to lower volumes in 2006, principally in
 the Midwestern and Eastern Groups. The decline in revenue due to
 lower volumes for our collection operations was also due to a
 decrease in hurricane related revenues in the South.

The revenue declines in our collection businesses in 2006 were
 partially offset by increased disposal volumes in all of our
 geographic regions through the first nine months of the year.
 Our special waste, municipal solid waste and construction and
 demolition waste streams were the primary drivers of this growth
 in revenues due to higher volumes. We believe that the strength
 of the economy throughout most of the year and favorable weather
 in many parts of the country were the primary drivers of the
 higher disposal volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we
 experienced a decline in disposal volumes as compared with the
 fourth quarter of 2005, which we believe is due to the lack of
 hurricane volumes in 2006, competition, impacts of our pricing
 initiatives and an economic softening in certain lines of our
 business in certain parts of the country.

Also contributing to the decline in our revenues due to lower
 volumes for 2006 were (i) the completion of the
 construction of an integrated waste facility on behalf of a
 municipality in Canada in early 2006; (ii) the
 deconsolidation of a variable interest entity during the second
 quarter of 2006; and (iii) decreased volumes from our
 transfer station and recycling operations.

Revenues due to changes in volumes were relatively flat when
 comparing 2005 with 2004. This was generally because of the
 combined impacts of (i) a decline in revenues associated
 with hurricanes; (ii) increases in recycling and landfill
 disposal volumes; and (iii) lower revenue from residential,
 commercial and industrial collection volumes, particularly in
 the East and Midwest, which can generally be attributed to our
 focus on improving our margins by increasing yield.

Our revenue due to volumes generated from hurricane related
 services were 56 million for the year ended
 December 31, 2005 as compared with 115 million for
 the year ended December 31, 2004. The 59 million
 decline was partially due to the temporary suspension of certain
 of our operations in the Gulf Coast region during 2005 as a
 result of the severe destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. In
 addition, much of our 2004 hurricane related revenues was
 associated with subcontracted services, which generated
 comparatively lower margins. In 2005, we generally elected not
 to undertake hurricane related projects for which we could not
 support the required services with internal resources.

When excluding the impacts of the hurricanes, revenue due to
 higher volumes increased 62 million, or 0.5 during 2005.
 This increase was largely due to (i) increased recycling
 volumes provided by several brokerage contracts;
 (ii) increased landfill disposal volumes in the Midwest,
 West and South; (iii) increased transfer station volumes in
 the West and the South; and (iv) increased residential
 collection volumes in the West. Also included as a component of
 revenue growth from volumes in 2005 was revenue generated from
 our construction of an integrated waste facility on behalf of a
 municipality in Canada. Additionally, in 2006, the increase in
 our subcontractor costs due to higher fuel costs was partially
 offset by a decrease attributable to our divestiture of
 under-performing and non-strategic operations and decreases in
 volumes.

In 2005, we also incurred additional transportation costs due to
 increased volumes in subcontracted work, particularly in our
 National Accounts organization and our Western Group. This cost
 increase was partially offset by a
 year-over-year 
 decline in the utilization of subcontractors to assist in
 providing hurricane related services, which were particularly
 significant during 2004.

Cost of goods sold These costs are primarily
 for rebates paid to our recycling suppliers, which are driven by
 the market prices of recyclable commodities. In 2006, we
 experienced lower market prices for recyclable commodities and
 reduced recycling volumes.

Additionally, in 2006, the decrease in costs of goods sold was
 partially due to completion of the construction of an integrated
 waste facility in Canada in early 2006. Certain of these cost
 increases are passed through to our customers, and have been
 reflected as fee yield increases within Operating
 Revenues. 

Landfill operating costs For 2006 and 2005,
 these cost increases have generally been related to higher site
 maintenance, leachate collection, monitoring and testing, and
 closure and post-closure expenses.

Risk management Over the last two years, we
 have been increasingly successful in reducing these costs
 largely due to reduced workers compensation costs, which
 can be attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced
 accident and injury rates.

Other operating expenses The lower costs in
 2006 as compared with 2005 can be attributed to
 (i) Hurricane Katrina related support costs in 2005,
 particularly in Louisiana, where we built Camp Waste Management
 to house and feed hundreds of our employees who worked in the
 New Orleans area to help with the cleanup efforts;
 (ii) higher rental expense in 2005; and (iii) a
 decrease related to the deconsolidation of a variable interest
 entity in early 2006.

In addition to the 2005 items noted above, the increase in our
 other operating costs when comparing 2005 with 2004 can be
 attributed to (i) a
 year-over-year 
 decrease in the realization of gains on sales of assets;
 (ii) costs incurred during 2005 attributable to labor
 strikes in New Jersey and Canada; and (iii) an increase in
 costs generated by the variable interest entity discussed above.

Our professional fees and, to a lesser extent, our labor costs
 and other general and administrative costs, for the year ended
 December 31, 2006 were increased by 20 million for
 non-capitalizable costs incurred to support the planned
 implementation of our new revenue management system. This
 increase and other significant changes in our selling, general
 and administrative expenses are summarized below.

Labor and related benefits In both 2006 and
 2005, these costs increased
 year-over-year 
 due to higher bonus expense attributable to the overall
 improvement in our performance and higher non-cash compensation
 costs associated with the equity-based compensation provided for
 by our long-term incentive plan. For additional information regarding this
 matter refer to Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial
 Statements.

Year
 Ended December 31, 2005 

Asset impairments During the second quarter
 of 2005, our Eastern Group recorded a 35 million charge
 for the impairment of the Pottstown Landfill located in West
 Pottsgrove Township, Pennsylvania. We determined that an
 impairment was necessary after the Pennsylvania Environmental
 Hearing Board upheld a denial by the Pennsylvania Department of
 Environmental Protection of a permit application for a vertical
 expansion at the landfill. After the denial was upheld, the
 Company reviewed the options available at the Pottstown Landfill
 and the likelihood of the possible outcomes of those options.
 After such evaluation and considering the length of time
 required for the appeal process and the permit application
 review, we decided not to pursue an appeal of the permit denial.
 This decision was primarily due to the expected impact of the
 permitting delays, which would hinder our ability to fully
 utilize the expansion airspace before the landfill s
 required closure in 2010. The Group incurred similar costs during the
 first quarter of 2005 for a labor strike in New Jersey, which
 decreased operating income for the year ended December 31,
 2005 by approximately 9 million.

Midwest Positively affecting 2005 results
 compared with the prior year was a decline in landfill
 amortization expense generally as a result of changes in certain
 estimates related to our final capping, closure and post-closure
 obligations.

Southern During 2005, several large
 non-recurring type items were recognized, impacting comparisons
 to the other periods presented. These items include
 13 million of pre-tax gains recognized on the divestiture
 of operations during 2005 and declines in earnings related to
 (i) hurricanes, largely due to the temporary suspension of
 operations in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina;
 (ii) the effects of higher landfill amortization costs,
 generally due to reductions in landfill amortization periods to
 align the lives of the landfills for amortization purposes with
 the terms of the underlying contractual agreements supporting
 their operations; and (iii) higher landfill amortization
 expense as a result of changes in certain estimates related to
 our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations.

Western Gains on divestitures of operations
 were 48 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
 as compared with 24 million for 2005 and 10 million
 for 2004.

Wheelabrator The electric rates we charge to
 our customers at our
 waste-to-energy 
 facilities increased significantly during the latter portion of
 2005 as a result of higher market prices for natural gas. The
 rates we charge customers are indexed to natural gas prices,
 which increased significantly as a result of hurricane-related
 production disruptions, increased demand and increases in crude
 oil prices. This increase in rates was the principal reason for
 the 2005 increase in Wheelabrator s income from operations
 as compared with 2004.","We have announced several programs and strategies that we have
 implemented or planned to improve our margins and operating
 results. For example, except when prohibited by contract, we
 have implemented price increases and environmental fees, and we
 continue our fuel surcharge programs, all of which have
 increased our internal revenue growth. The loss of volumes as a
 result of price increases may negatively affect our cash flows
 or results of operations. Our
 second and third quarter revenues and results of operations
 typically reflect these seasonal trends. Additionally, the storm
 conditions during hurricane season, which is generally June
 through November, can increase our revenues in the areas
 affected. However, for several reasons, including significant
 start-up 
 costs, storm-related revenue often generates comparatively lower
 margins. Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary
 suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the
 operating results of the affected regions. The operating results
 of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and
 maintenance expenses because we perform scheduled maintenance at
 our
 waste-to-energy 
 facilities in the slower winter months, when electrical demand
 is generally lower.

Our business is affected by changes in national and general
 economic factors that are also outside of our control, including
 interest rates and consumer confidence. We also face
 risks related to other adverse external factors, such as the
 ability of our insurers to meet their commitments in a timely
 manner and the effect that significant claims or litigation
 against insurance companies may have on such ability.

Any of the factors described above could materially adversely
 affect our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally,
 due to these and other factors, operating results in any interim
 period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for
 an entire year, and operating results for any historical period
 are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future
 period.

We
 cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under
 environmental, health and safety laws, and cannot guarantee that
 they will not be material. 

We could be liable if our operations cause environmental damage
 to our properties or to the property of other landowners,
 particularly as a result of the contamination of air, drinking
 water or soil. Under current law, we could even be held liable
 for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired
 the assets or operations involved. Also, we could be liable if
 we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of
 hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination, or
 if a predecessor owner made such arrangements and under
 applicable law we are treated as a successor to the prior owner.
 Any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a
 material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
 operations and cash flows.

In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, and
 may in the future, become involved in a variety of legal and
 administrative proceedings relating to land use and
 environmental laws and regulations. These include proceedings in
 which:

agencies of federal, state, local or foreign governments seek to
 impose liability on us under applicable statutes, sometimes
 involving civil or criminal penalties for violations, or to
 revoke or deny renewal of a permit we need; and

local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners or
 governmental agencies oppose the issuance of a permit or
 approval we need, allege violations of the permits under which
 we operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or
 seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage.

We generally seek to work with the authorities or other persons
 involved in these proceedings to resolve any issues raised. If
 we are not successful, the adverse outcome of one or more of
 these proceedings could result in, among other things, material
 increases in our costs or liabilities as well as material
 charges for asset impairments.

The
 waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation,
 and existing or future regulations, may restrict our operations,
 increase our costs of operations or require us to make
 additional capital expenditures. 

Stringent government regulations at the federal, state,
 provincial, and local level in the United States and Canada have
 a substantial impact on our business. A large number of complex
 laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental
 protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and
 related matters. Among other things, they may restrict our
 operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results
 of operations and cash flows by imposing conditions such as:

limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal,
 transfer or processing facilities or expanding existing
 facilities;

limitations, regulations or levies on collection and disposal
 prices, rates and volumes;

limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of
 out-of-state 
 waste or certain categories of waste; or

mandates regarding the disposal of solid waste

Regulations affecting the siting, design and closure of
 landfills could require us to undertake investigatory or
 remedial activities, curtail operations or close landfills
 temporarily or permanently. Future changes in these regulations
 may require us to modify, supplement or replace equipment or
 facilities. The costs of complying with these regulations could
 be substantial.

In order to develop, expand or operate a landfill or other waste
 management facility, we must have various facility permits and
 other governmental approvals, including those relating to
 zoning, environmental protection and land use. The permits and
 approvals are often difficult, time consuming and costly to
 obtain and could contain conditions that limit our operations.

Significant
 shortages in fuel supply or increases in fuel prices will
 increase our operating expenses and price increases may also
 increase our tax expense. 

The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable, and can
 fluctuate significantly based on international, political and
 economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our
 control, such as actions by OPEC and other oil and gas
 producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and
 environmental concerns. In the past two years, the
 year-over-year 
 changes in the average quarterly fuel prices have ranged from an
 increase of 40 to a decrease of 5 . The ability to earn
 Section 45K tax credits is tied to an average benchmark oil
 price determined by the Internal Revenue Service, and the
 credits are phased out as the benchmark average price increases.
 Higher crude oil prices will phase out our credits and increase
 our effective tax rate, which will result in higher tax expense.

We
 have substantial financial assurance and insurance requirements,
 and increases in the costs of obtaining adequate financial
 assurance, or the inadequacy of our insurance coverages, could
 negatively impact our liquidity and increase our
 liabilities. 

The amount of insurance we are required to maintain for
 environmental liability is governed by statutory requirements.
 We believe that the cost for such insurance is high relative to
 the coverage it would provide, and

15

Table of Contents 

therefore, our coverages are generally maintained at the minimum
 statutorily required levels. We face the risk of incurring
 liabilities for environmental damage if our insurance coverage
 is ultimately inadequate to cover those damages. We also carry a
 broad range of insurance coverages that are customary for a
 company our size. We use these programs to mitigate risk of
 loss, thereby allowing us to manage our self-insurance exposure
 associated with claims. To the extent our insurers were unable
 to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims
 were more than we estimated, there could be a material adverse
 effect to our financial results.

In addition, to fulfill our financial assurance obligations with
 respect to environmental closure and post-closure liabilities,
 we generally obtain letters of credit or surety bonds, rely on
 insurance, including captive insurance, or fund trust and escrow
 accounts. We currently have in place all financial assurance
 instruments necessary for our operations.","['When you look at -- we talk about Special Waste quite often that Special Waste jobs can be lumpy.

Some of the risks that we face and that could affect our
 business and financial statements for 2007 and beyond include:

competition may negatively affect our profitability or cash
 flows, our price increases may have negative effects on volumes
 and price roll-backs and lower than average pricing to retain

we may not be able to successfully execute or continue our
 operational or other margin improvement plans and programs,
 including pricing increases; passing on increased costs to our
 customers; reducing costs due to our operational improvement
 programs; and divesting under-performing assets and purchasing
 accretive businesses, any of which could negatively affect our
 revenues and margins;

weather conditions cause our quarter-to-quarter results to
 fluctuate, and extremely harsh weather or natural disasters may
 cause us to temporarily shut down operations;

inflation and resulting higher interest rates as well as other
 general and local economic conditions may negatively affect the
 volumes of waste generated, our financing costs and other
 expenses;

possible changes in our estimates of site remediation
 requirements, final capping, closure and post-closure
 obligations, compliance and regulatory developments may increase
 our expenses;

 emissions, may negatively impact our business by, among other
 things, restricting our operations, increasing costs of
 operations or requiring additional capital expenditures;

General 

Our principal executive offices are located at 1001 Fannin
 Street, Suite 4000, Houston, Texas 77002. We must make
 these estimates and assumptions because certain information that
 we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with
 a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot
 be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies.
 In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to
 determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In
 preparing our financial statements the most difficult,
 subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal
 with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting
 for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset
 impairments and self-insurance reserves and recoveries, as
 described in Item 7 of our Annual Report on
 Form 10-K 
 for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Operating
 Revenues 

Our operating revenues were 3.2 billion for the three
 months ended March 31, 2007 and 2006. As discussed below, the
 significant increase in our collection revenues due to pricing
 have been partially offset by revenue declines from lower
 collection volumes. In assessing the impact of higher collection
 yield on our volumes, we continue to find that, in spite of
 volume declines, increased base business yield and a focus on
 controlling variable costs are providing notable margin
 improvements.

In addition to the improvements in the collection line of
 business, we experienced yield contributions to revenues from
 our transfer stations and on municipal solid waste and
 construction and demolition waste streams at our landfills.
 Revenue declines at our
 waste-to-energy 
 facilities were largely due to decreases in rates charged for
 electricity under our long-term contracts with electric
 utilities, which are generally indexed to natural gas prices.

Revenues from our environmental fee, which is included in base
 business yield, were 22 million during the first quarter
 of 2007 as compared with 12 million in the comparable
 prior year period.

Commodity Our first quarter revenues from
 recycling commodities increased due to market price increases.
 Average prices for old corrugated cardboard increased
 approximately 83 , from 58 per ton in the first quarter of
 2006 to 106 per ton in the first quarter of 2007. Average
 prices for old newsprint have increased approximately 39 , from
 76 per ton in the first quarter of 2006 to 106 per
 ton in the first quarter of 2007. The decline in revenues due to reduced
 volumes was most significant for our industrial collection
 business and affected all of our geographic Groups, with our
 Southern, Eastern and Midwest Groups experiencing the most
 notable decreases.

Declines in revenue due to lower volumes in our transfer station
 operations were experienced in every geographic operating Group,
 with the most notable decline in our Eastern Group. The
 volume-related revenue decline in our recycling business is
 primarily attributable to decreases in certain brokerage
 activities and the closure of a plastics processing facility.

Additional factors contributing to the declines in our first
 quarter 2007 revenues due to volumes were (i) the absence
 of revenues associated with hurricane-related services provided
 during the first quarter of 2006; (ii) nearly one less
 workday during the first quarter of 2007 as compared with the
 first quarter of 2006; and (iii) the deconsolidation of a
 variable interest entity during the second quarter of 2006.

Our disposal volumes remained relatively flat for the three
 months ended March 31, 2007 as compared with the same
 period in 2006. This primarily represents increased special
 waste volumes, largely offset by decreases in our construction
 and demolition waste streams.

Divestitures Divestitures of under-performing
 or non-strategic operations accounted for decreased revenues of
 65 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007.
 These divestitures were primarily comprised of collection
 operations and, to a lesser extent, recycling and transfer
 station operations.

Operating
 Expenses 

Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related
 benefits (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and
 repairs included below), which include salaries and wages,
 bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and
 the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and
 disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third party
 disposal facilities and transfer stations;
 (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to equipment,
 vehicles and facilities and related labor costs;
 (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of
 independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal
 facilities and are driven by transportation costs such as fuel
 prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily the
 rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities;
 (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oil
 to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment;
 (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include
 landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees
 and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which
 include landfill remediation costs, leachate and methane
 collection and treatment, other landfill site costs and interest
 accretion on asset retirement obligations; (ix) risk
 management costs, which include workers compensation and
 insurance and claim costs; and (x) other operating costs,
 which include, among other costs, equipment and facility rent
 and property taxes.

Our operating expenses for the three months ended March 31,
 2007 decreased by 3.1 as compared with the prior year period.
 This decrease can primarily be attributed to our efforts to
 maximize margin expansion by focusing on managing our fixed
 costs and reducing our variable costs as volumes decline due to
 our pricing program and divestiture activity. In addition to
 lowering overall costs, our operating expenses as a percentage
 of revenues decreased by 1.2 percentage points, from 65.0 
 in the first quarter 2006 to 63.8 in the current period. The
 improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues
 reflects our continued focus on identifying operational
 efficiencies that translate into cost savings, shedding low
 margin volumes and divesting operations that are not improving.

Other items affecting the comparability of our operating
 expenses by category for the three months ended March 31,
 2007 and 2006 include:

labor and related benefit cost increases due to annual merit
 increases;

maintenance and repairs cost decreases due to changes in the
 scope of maintenance projects at our
 waste-to-energy 
 facilities and various fleet initiatives that favorably affected
 our maintenance, parts and supplies costs;

a subcontractor cost decline in 2007 as compared with 2006 due
 to our utilization of subcontractors to assist in providing
 hurricane related services during the first quarter of 2006;

36

Table of Contents 

costs of goods sold increases due to higher market prices for
 commodities;

a disposal and franchise fee and tax decline due to the
 favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in our Eastern
 Group, which resulted in the recognition of a 15 million
 favorable adjustment to operating costs and 7 million of
 interest income during the first quarter of 2007, and was the
 primary driver of the 11.8 decline in this cost category;

a landfill operating cost increase due to an 8 million
 charge for the revision in our estimate associated with
 remediation costs for one of our closed landfills, which was the
 primary driver of the 26.0 increase in this cost category;

risk management expense decreases, particularly for reduced
 costs related to auto and general liability claims; and

an other expense increase due to 21 million of lease
 termination costs associated with purchasing one of our
 independent power production plants that was previously operated
 through a lease agreement, which was the primary driver of the
 10.4 increase in our other operating expenses, partially offset
 by gains recognized on sales of assets.

Selling,
 General and Administrative 

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of
 (i) labor costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related
 insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and
 equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which
 include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services;
 (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances
 for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and
 (iv) other general and administrative expenses, which
 include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and
 data telecommunications, advertising, travel and entertainment,
 rentals, postage and printing.

Provision for bad debts In recent quarters,
 we have begun to experience maturation of processes implemented
 to assist in our collection efforts. The decline in our
 provision for bad debts when comparing the current quarter with
 the same period of the prior year can be attributed to these
 efforts.

Other We are currently undergoing unclaimed
 property audits in three states. In addition to our working
 capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our
 ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the
 construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions
 to and maintenance of our trucking fleet;
 (iii) refurbishments and improvements at
 waste-to-energy 
 and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and
 equipment needs of our operations; (v) capping, closure and
 post-closure activities at our landfills; and (vi) repaying
 debt and discharging other obligations. We are also committed to
 providing our shareholders with a return on their investment
 through our capital allocation program that provides for
 dividend payments, share repurchases and investments in
 acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide
 continued growth in our business.

As of March 31, 2007, the current portion of our debt
 includes 300 million of 7.125 senior notes that
 mature in October 2007, 303 million of advances
 outstanding under our Canadian credit facility and
 62 million of tax-exempt project bonds. Generally, we
 expect to repay these obligations with available cash at
 maturity. Our second and third quarter revenues
 and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal
 trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions
 that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as
 the hurricanes experienced in 2004 and 2005, can actually
 increase our revenues in the areas affected. However, for
 several reasons, including significant
 start-up 
 costs, such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins.
 Certain weather conditions may result in the temporary
 suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the
 operating results of the affected regions. The operating results
 of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and
 maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter
 months, when electrical demand is generally lower, to perform
 scheduled maintenance at our
 waste-to-energy 
 facilities.

While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of
 fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent periods, we
 believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near
 future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on
 our results of operations. However, management s estimates
 associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have,
 an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental

"Additionally, we assume no obligation to update
 any forward-looking statement as a result of future events,
 circumstances or developments. The following discussion should
 be read together with the Condensed Consolidated Financial
 Statements and the notes thereto.

Some of the risks that we face and that could affect our
 business and financial statements for 2007 and beyond include:

competition may negatively affect our profitability or cash
 flows, our price increases may have negative effects on volumes,
 and price roll-backs and lower than average pricing to retain
 and attract customers may negatively affect our yield on base
 business;

we may be unable to maintain or expand margins if we are unable
 to control costs;

we may not be able to successfully execute or continue our
 operational or other margin improvement plans and programs, such
 as pricing increases; passing on increased costs to our
 customers; reducing costs due to our operational improvement
 programs; and divesting under-performing assets and purchasing
 accretive businesses, any of which could negatively affect our
 revenues and margins;

weather conditions cause our quarter-to-quarter results to
 fluctuate, and extremely harsh weather or natural disasters may
 cause us to temporarily shut down operations;

inflation and resulting higher interest rates as well as other
 general and local economic conditions may negatively affect the
 volumes of waste generated, our financing costs and other
 expenses;

possible changes in our estimates of site remediation
 requirements, final capping, closure and post-closure
 obligations, compliance and regulatory developments may increase
 our expenses;

regulations, including regulations to limit greenhouse gas
 emissions, may negatively impact our business by, among other
 things, restricting our operations, increasing costs of
 operations or requiring additional capital expenditures;

if we are unable to obtain and maintain permits needed to open,
 operate,
 and/or 
 expand our facilities, our results of operations will be
 negatively impacted;

limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of
 out-of-state, cross-border, or certain categories of waste, as
 well as mandates regarding the disposal of waste, can increase
 our expenses and reduce our revenues;

fuel price increases or fuel supply shortages may increase our
 expenses, including our tax expense if Section 45K credits
 are phased out due to continued high crude oil prices, or
 restrict our ability to operate;

increased costs to obtain financial assurance or the inadequacy
 of our insurance coverages could negatively impact our liquidity
 and increase our liabilities;

30

Table of Contents 

possible charges as a result of shut-down operations,
 uncompleted development or expansion projects or other events
 may negatively affect earnings;

fluctuating commodity prices may have negative effects on our
 operating revenues and expenses;

trends requiring recycling, waste reduction at the source and
 prohibiting the disposal of certain types of waste could have
 negative effects on volumes of waste going to landfills and
 waste-to-energy facilities;

efforts by labor unions to organize our employees may increase
 operating expenses and we may be unable to negotiate acceptable
 collective bargaining agreements with those who have been chosen
 to be represented by unions, which could lead to labor
 disruptions, including strikes and lock-outs, which could
 adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows;

negative outcomes of litigation or threatened litigation or
 governmental proceedings may increase our costs, limit our
 ability to conduct or expand our operations, or limit our
 ability to execute our business plans and strategies;

problems with the operation of our current information
 technology or the development and deployment of new information
 systems may decrease our efficiencies and increase our costs to
 operate;

the adoption of new accounting standards or interpretations may
 cause fluctuations in reported quarterly results of operations
 or adversely impact our reported results of operations; and

we may reduce or eliminate our dividend or share repurchase
 program or we may need to raise additional capital if cash flows
 are less than we expect or capital expenditures are more than we
 expect, and we may not be able to obtain any needed capital on
 acceptable terms.

These are not the only risks that we face. There may be other
 risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe
 are immaterial which could also impair our business and
 financial position.

General 

Our principal executive offices are located at 1001 Fannin
 Street, Suite 4000, Houston, Texas 77002. We must make
 these estimates and assumptions because certain information that
 we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with
 a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot
 be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies.
 In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to
 determine and we must exercise significant judgment. In
 preparing our financial statements the most difficult,
 subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal
 with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting
 for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, asset
 impairments and self-insurance reserves and recoveries, as
 described in Item 7 of our Annual Report on
 Form 10-K 
 for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Operating
 Revenues 

Our operating revenues for the three and six months ended
 June 30, 2007 were 3.4 billion and 6.5 billion,
 respectively, compared with 3.4 billion and
 6.6 billion for the three and six months ended
 June 30, 2006, respectively. Shown below (in millions) is
 the contribution to revenues during each period provided by our
 six operating Groups and our other waste services:

Our operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our
 collection, disposal, transfer, Wheelabrator and recycling
 services. However, when comparing the six months ended
 June 30, 2007 with the same period of the prior year, we
 experienced declines in revenue from yield at our
 waste-to-energy facilities. The changes in revenue from yield
 provided by our waste-to-energy business are largely due to
 fluctuations in rates charged for electricity under our
 long-term contracts, which generally are indexed to natural gas
 prices.

Revenues from our environmental fee, which is included in base
 business yield, were 31 million and 53 million
 during the three and six months ended June 30, 2007,
 respectively, compared with 20 million and
 32 million in the comparable prior year periods.

Commodity Revenues attributable to recycling
 commodities increased in both the three and six months ended
 June 30, 2007 when compared with 2006 due to price
 increases in the recycling commodities that we process. During
 the first six months of 2007, average prices for old corrugated
 cardboard increased by about 66 , from 64 per ton in 2006 to
 106 per ton in 2007. Operating expenses as a percentage
 of revenues decreased by 1.8 percentage points for the six
 months ended June 30, 2007, from 64.8 in the first half of
 2006 to 63.0 in the first half of 2007. The improvement in
 operating expenses as a percentage of revenues reflects our
 continued focus on identifying operational efficiencies that
 translate into cost savings, shedding low margin volumes and
 divesting operations that are not improving.

36

Table of Contents 

Other items affecting the comparability of our operating
 expenses by category for the three and six months ended
 June 30, 2007 and 2006 include:

Labor and related benefits cost increases due to
 annual merit increases;

Maintenance and repairs cost decreases due to
 changes in the scope and timing of maintenance projects at our
 waste-to-energy facilities and various fleet initiatives that
 favorably affected our maintenance, parts and supplies costs;

higher Subcontractor costs in 2006 due to our
 utilization of subcontractors during the first quarter of 2006
 to assist in providing hurricane related services;

Cost of goods sold increases due to higher market
 prices for commodities;

a decline in Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 
 due to the favorable resolution of a disposal tax matter in our
 Eastern Group, which resulted in the recognition of a
 15 million favorable adjustment to operating costs during
 the first quarter of 2007;

a Landfill operating costs increase due to charges
 for revisions in our estimates associated with remediation
 obligations, particularly during the first quarter of 2007;

Risk management expense decreases, particularly for
 reduced actuarial projections of claim losses for workers 
 compensation and auto and general liability claims, which can be
 attributed to our continued focus on safety and reduced accident
 and injury rates; and

a decrease in Other expenses in the current quarter
 due in large part to lower costs for security and travel
 expenses attributable to labor disputes. This is primarily due
 to a strike in the New York City area during the second quarter
 of 2006, but was partially offset by similar costs incurred in
 June 2007 related to a labor dispute in California. In addition to our working
 capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our
 ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the
 construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions
 to and maintenance of our trucking fleet;
 (iii) refurbishments and improvements at waste-to-energy
 and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and
 equipment needs of our operations; (v) capping, closure and
 post-closure activities at our landfills; and (vi) repaying
 debt and discharging other obligations. We are also committed to
 providing our shareholders with a return on their investment
 through our capital allocation program that provides for
 dividend payments, share repurchases and investments in
 acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide
 continued growth in our business.

As of June 30, 2007, the most significant components of the
 current portion of our debt included 300 million of
 7.125 senior notes that mature in October 2007,
 70 million of advances outstanding under our Canadian
 credit facility and 62 million of tax-exempt project
 bonds. The significant decline in the current portion of our
 debt from December 31, 2006 is largely due to our
 classification of 240 million of the borrowings under the
 Canadian credit facility as long-term as of June 30, 2007.
 As of June 30, 2007, we expect to repay 70 million of
 the outstanding advances with available cash within one year and
 renew the remaining borrowings under the terms of the facility,
 which matures in November 2008. Our second and third quarter revenues
 and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal
 trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions
 that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as
 the hurricanes experienced in 2004 and 2005, can actually
 increase our revenues in the areas affected. However, for
 several reasons, including significant
 start-up 
 costs, such revenue often generates comparatively lower margins.
 Certain weather conditions may actually result in the temporary
 suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the
 operating results of the affected regions. The operating results
 of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and
 maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter
 months, when waste flows are generally lower, to perform
 scheduled maintenance at our waste-to-energy facilities.

While inflationary increases in costs, including the cost of
 fuel, have affected our operating margins in recent periods, we
 believe that inflation generally has not had, and in the near
 future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on
 our results of operations. However, management s estimates
 associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have,
 an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental
 remediation liabilities.

"International Propane s Fiscal 2010
contribution to net income attributable to UGI Corporation was significantly lower than in Fiscal
2009 as the prior-year s results benefited from unit margins at Antargaz that were significantly
higher than normal following a precipitous decline in LPG commodity costs that occurred as Antargaz
entered the Fiscal 2009 winter heating season. AmeriGas Propane s contribution to earnings was
 17.7 million lower in Fiscal 2010 principally reflecting the absence of an after-tax gain from the sale of the
Partnership s California storage facility recorded in Fiscal 2009 10.4 million), the impact of
after-tax losses on interest rate protection agreements recorded in Fiscal 2010 3.3 million) and
the effects of lower Partnership total margin.

Looking ahead, we expect our results in Fiscal 2011 to be influenced by a number of factors
including, among others, heating-season temperatures in our business units service territories;
the strength of the economic recovery in the United States and Europe; declining LPG usage
resulting from competition from other types of energy and ongoing customer conservation; and the
level and volatility of commodity prices for natural gas, LPG and electricity.

We believe that each of our business units has sufficient liquidity in the form of revolving
credit facilities and, in the case of Energy Services, an accounts receivable securitization
facility to fund business operations in Fiscal 2011. We have 380 million of Antargaz term loans
and 25.4 million of Flaga term loans maturing in Fiscal 2011. Partnership EBITDA (and operating
income) in Fiscal 2010 includes a pre-tax loss of 12.2 million associated with the
discontinuance of interest rate hedges and a loss of 7 million associated with an increase
in a litigation accrual. Partnership EBITDA (and operating income) in Fiscal 2009 includes a
pre-tax gain of 39.9 million associated with the sale of the Partnership s California LPG
storage facility.

 Deviation from average heating degree-days for the 30-year period 1971-2000 based upon
national weather statistics provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA for 335 airports in the United States, excluding Alaska. Fiscal 2009 data has been
adjusted to correct a NOAA error.

Based upon heating degree-day data, average temperatures in our service territories were 2.2 
warmer than normal during Fiscal 2010 compared with temperatures in the prior year that were 3.1 
warmer than normal. Fiscal 2010 retail gallons sold were lower reflecting, among other things, the
lingering effects of the economic recession, customer conservation and customer attrition partially
offset by volumes acquired through business acquisitions.

Retail propane revenues increased 20.2 million during Fiscal 2010 reflecting an increase as a
result of higher average retail sales prices 94.3 million) partially offset by lower retail
volumes sold 74.1 million). In January 2009, Flaga purchased for cash consideration
the 50 equity interest in ZLH it did not already own. International Propane acquisitions completed
during Fiscal 2010 did not have a material effect on results of operations.

Based upon heating degree day data, temperatures in Antargaz service territory were 0.5 
warmer than normal during Fiscal 2010 compared with temperatures that were 2.9 warmer than normal
during Fiscal 2009. Temperatures in Flaga s service territory were slightly colder than the prior
year. The average wholesale commodity price for propane and butane in northwest Europe during
Fiscal 2010 was approximately 48 higher than prices during Fiscal 2009. U.S. dollar income before income taxes decreased 32.5 million or 26.6 .

warmer than normal in Fiscal 2010 compared with temperatures that were 4.1 colder than normal in
Fiscal 2009. Total distribution system throughput increased 4.2 bcf in Fiscal 2010, despite the
warmer weather, principally reflecting an 8.5 bcf increase in low margin interruptible delivery
service volumes. Gas Utility s core market volumes decreased 6.2 bcf (9.0 due to the previously
mentioned warmer weather and to a lesser extent the sluggish economy and customer conservation. Gas
Utility s core-market customers are comprised of firm- residential, commercial and industrial retail core-market customers who purchase their gas from Gas Utility and, to a much lesser
extent, residential and small commercial customers who purchase their gas from alternate suppliers.

Table of Contents 

Gas Utility revenues decreased 193.5 million during Fiscal 2010 principally reflecting a
decline in revenues from retail core-market customers 232.3 million) partially offset by a 29.4
million increase in revenues from low-margin off-system sales. The increase is principally the result of the PNG Gas and
CPG Gas base operating revenue increases 28.2 million) substantially offset by the effect on
total margin from the lower core-market volumes.

Gas Utility operating income in Fiscal 2010 increased 21.8 million principally reflecting
lower operating and administrative costs 15.6 million) and the previously mentioned increase in
total margin 6.3 million). Fiscal 2010 operating and administrative costs include, among other
things, lower uncollectible accounts and customer assistance expenses 11.5 million) and lower
costs associated with environmental matters 6.6 million). These decreases were partially offset
by higher depreciation expense 2.2 million) and higher pension expense 2.1 million). Electric Utility gross receipts taxes, of
 6.6 million and 7.6 million during
Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009, respectively. For financial statement purposes,
revenue-related taxes are included in Utility taxes other than income taxes on the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Temperatures based upon heating degree days in Fiscal 2010 were approximately 6.8 warmer than
in Fiscal 2009. The impact on kilowatt-hour sales from the warmer heating-season weather was more
than offset by higher air-conditioning related sales from significantly warmer 2010 late spring and
summer weather.

Electric Utility revenues decreased 18.3 million principally as a result of certain
commercial and industrial customers switching to an alternate supplier for the generation portion
of their service and, to a lesser extent, lower default service DS rates effective January 1,
2010. Electric Utility decreased its DS rates effective January 1, 2010 pursuant to a January 22,

Highlights Fiscal 2009 versus Fiscal 2008 

Higher unit margins at AmeriGas Propane and Antargaz in Fiscal 2009 reflect significant
declines in LPG commodity prices entering our critical heating season.

Most of our business units experienced Fiscal 2009 heating-season temperatures that
were to varying degrees colder than in Fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2009 Gas Utility results include the benefit of the CPG Acquisition on October
1, 2008.

AmeriGas Partners sale of its California LPG storage terminal generated net income of
 10.4 million in Fiscal 2009.

The global economic recession reduced overall business activity in all of our business
units.

International Propane Fiscal 2009 results reflect a 10.0 million charge for the
Antargaz Competition Authority Matter.

Midstream Marketing s Fiscal 2009 results were adversely impacted by lower income
from electricity generation.

Electric Utility Fiscal 2009 results were lower reflecting the effects of higher cost
of sales and lower demand as a result of the recession.

 Partnership EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and
amortization) should not be considered as an alternative to net income (as an indicator of
operating performance) and is not a measure of performance or financial condition under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management uses
Partnership EBITDA as the primary measure of segment profitability for the AmeriGas Propane
segment (see Note 21 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Partnership EBITDA and operating
income in Fiscal 2009 includes a pre-tax gain of 39.9 million associated with the sale of the
Partnership s California LPG storage facility.

adjusted to correct a NOAA error.

Based upon heating degree-day data, average temperatures in our service territories during
Fiscal 2009 were 3.1 warmer than normal compared with temperatures in the prior year that were
3.0 warmer than normal. Fiscal 2009 retail gallons sold were 6.5 lower than Fiscal 2008
reflecting, among other things, the adverse effects of the significant deterioration in general
economic activity which occurred over the last year and continued customer conservation. U.S. dollar amounts include Antargaz and
Flaga as well as our operations in China and certain non-operating entities associated with our
International Propane segment.

Based upon heating degree day data, temperatures in Antargaz service territory were
approximately 2.9 warmer than normal during Fiscal 2009 compared with temperatures that were
approximately 4.1 warmer than normal during Fiscal 2008. Temperatures in Flaga s service territory
were warmer than normal and warmer than Fiscal 2008. Wholesale propane product costs declined
significantly during late Fiscal 2008 and the first quarter of Fiscal 2009 as we entered the
critical winter heating season. Similar
declines in average wholesale butane prices were experienced in Fiscal 2009. Antargaz Fiscal 2009
retail LPG volumes were slightly lower than in Fiscal 2008 reflecting the colder Fiscal 2009
weather offset by the effects of the deterioration of general economic conditions in France,
customer conservation and competition from alternate energy sources.

During Fiscal 2009, the average currency translation rate was 1.35 per euro compared to a
rate of 1.51 per euro during Fiscal 2008. Although the stronger dollar resulted in lower
translated International Propane operating results, the effects of the stronger dollar on reported
International Propane net income attributable to UGI Corporation were substantially offset by gains
on forward currency contracts used to hedge purchases of dollar-denominated LPG.

International Propane euro-based revenues decreased 37.1 million or 4.9 in Fiscal 2009
reflecting a decline in revenues from Antargaz 82.2 million), principally lower retail propane
revenues 61.9 million) from lower average selling prices, and lower Antargaz wholesale revenues 20.4 million). dollars, income before income taxes increased 49.0 million (67.1 principally
reflecting the benefit of the higher dollar-denominated operating income. Loss from International
Propane equity investees was higher in Fiscal 2009 due to expenditures associated with the
anticipated closure of an LPG storage facility.

Temperatures in the Gas Utility service territory based upon heating degree days were 4.1 
colder than normal in Fiscal 2009 compared with temperatures that were 2.7 warmer than normal in
Fiscal 2008. Total distribution system throughput increased 16.0 bcf in Fiscal 2009 principally
reflecting the effects of the October 1, 2008 CPG Acquisition (22.2 bcf) and increases in
core-market volumes resulting from the colder Fiscal 2009 weather and year-over-year customer
growth. These increases in system throughput were partially offset by the effects on volumes sold
and transported due to lower demand from commercial and industrial customers as a result of the
deterioration in general economic activity and customer conservation.

Gas Utility revenues increased 102.7 million in Fiscal 2009 principally reflecting
incremental revenues from CPG Gas 187.4 million) somewhat offset by lower revenues from
low-margin off-system sales 90.3 million). Gas Utility s cost of gas was 853.2 million in Fiscal
2009 compared with 831.1 million in Fiscal 2008 principally reflecting incremental cost of sales
associated with CPG Gas 117.0 million) partially offset principally by the cost of sales effect
of the lower off-system revenues 89.1 million).

Gas Utility total margin increased 80.6 million in Fiscal 2009 principally reflecting
incremental margin from CPG Gas 70.4 million) and higher total core-market margin from UGI Gas
and PNG Gas 11.3 million) resulting principally from the higher core-market volumes sold.

 Total margin represents total revenues less total cost of sales and revenue-related taxes,
i.e. Electric Utility gross receipts taxes, of 7.6 million and 7.9 million during Fiscal
2009 and Fiscal 2008, respectively. For financial statement purposes, revenue-related taxes
are included in Utility taxes other than income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of
Income.

Electric Utility s kilowatt-hour sales in Fiscal 2009 were lower than in Fiscal 2008.
Temperatures based upon heating degree days in Electric Utility s service territory were
approximately 5.0 colder than last year resulting in greater sales to Electric Utility s
residential heating customers. These greater sales were more than offset, however, by lower sales
to commercial and industrial customers as a result of the deterioration in general economic
activity and lower weather-related air-conditioning sales during the summer of Fiscal 2009.
Notwithstanding the lower sales, Electric Utility revenues were about equal with last year as a
result of higher POLR rates and greater revenues from spot market sales of electricity. Electric
Utility cost of sales increased to 91.6 million in Fiscal 2009 from 84.3 million in Fiscal 2008
principally reflecting greater purchased power costs.

Electric Utility total margin decreased 7.7 million during Fiscal 2009 principally reflecting
the higher cost of sales and, to a much lesser extent, the effects of the lower sales volumes.

Electric Utility operating income and income before income taxes in Fiscal 2009 were 9.0
million and 8.7 million lower than in Fiscal 2008, respectively, principally reflecting the
previously mentioned lower total margin 7.7 million) and higher operating and administrative
costs 0.9 million).

There are many factors that may affect our business and results of operations. Additional
discussion regarding factors that may affect our business and operating results is included
elsewhere in this Report.

Decreases in the demand for our energy products and services because of warmer-than-normal
heating season weather may adversely affect our results of operations. 

Because many of our customers rely on our energy products and services to heat their homes and
businesses, our results of operations are adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season
weather. Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our energy products and
services for both heating and agricultural purposes. Accordingly, the volume of our energy products
sold is at its highest during the peak heating season of October through March and is directly
affected by the severity of the winter weather. For example, historically, approximately 65 to 70 
of AmeriGas Partners annual retail propane volume, Gas Utility s natural gas throughput (the total
volume of gas sold to or transported for customers within our distribution system) and Antargaz 
annual retail LPG volume has been sold during these months. There can be no assurance that normal
winter weather in our market areas will occur in the future.

Our holding company structure could limit our ability to pay dividends or debt service. 

We are a holding company whose material assets are the stock of our subsidiaries. Payments to us by those
subsidiaries, in turn, depend upon their consolidated results of operations and cash flows. The
operations of our subsidiaries are affected by conditions beyond our control, including weather,
competition in national and international markets we serve, the costs and availability of propane,
butane, natural gas, electricity, and other energy sources and capital market conditions. The
ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us is also affected by the level of indebtedness of
our subsidiaries, which is substantial, and the restrictions on payments to us imposed under the
terms of such indebtedness.

Our profitability is subject to LPG pricing and inventory risk. 

The retail LPG distribution industry in the U.S., France, Austria and Denmark is mature, with
no growth, or modest declines in total demand foreseen. Given this forecast, we expect that
year-to-year industry volumes will be principally affected by weather patterns. Therefore, our
ability to grow within the LPG industry is dependent on our ability to acquire other retail
distributors and to achieve internal growth, which includes expansion of the domestic ACE and
Strategic Accounts programs in the U.S., as well as the success of our sales and marketing programs
designed to attract and retain customers. 

One of the ways we seek to grow our midstream asset business is by constructing new pipelines
and gathering systems, expanding our LNG facility and improving our gas storage facilities. These
construction projects involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties
beyond our control and require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. These projects
may not be completed on schedule, or at all, or at the anticipated costs. The PUC, among other things, approves the rates that UGI Utilities and its subsidiaries,
PNG and CPG, may charge their utility customers, thus impacting the returns that UGI Utilities may
earn on the assets that are dedicated to those operations. We expect that PNG and CPG will
periodically file requests with the PUC to increase base rates that each company charges customers.
If UGI Utilities is required in a rate proceeding to reduce the rates it charges its utility
customers, or if UGI Utilities is unable to obtain approval for timely rate increases from the PUC,
particularly when necessary to cover increased costs, UGI Utilities revenue growth will be limited
and earnings may decrease.

Our operations, capital expenditures and financial results may be affected by regulatory changes
and/or market responses to global climate change. 

There continues to be concern, both nationally and internationally, about climate change and
the contribution of greenhouse gas GHG emissions, most notably carbon dioxide, to global
warming.
In addition to carbon dioxide, greenhouse gases include, among others, methane, a component of natural gas.
While some states have adopted laws regulating the emission of GHGs for some industry
sectors, there is currently no federal regulation mandating the reduction of GHG emissions in the
United States. In June of 2009, the United States House of Representatives passed the American
Clean Energy and Security Act ACES Act ). The ACES Act would establish an economy-wide GHG
cap-and-trade system to reduce GHG emissions over time. The United States Senate has been
considering a number of related proposals, ranging from energy only bills to proposals that place
an economy-wide cap on greenhouse gas emissions. No legislation can be enacted until a final
reconciled bill is approved by both the House of Representatives and
the Senate and signed by the President.

23 

Table of Contents 

Even if Congress does not pass legislation mandating GHG emissions reductions, there continue to be regulatory
developments under the Clean Air Act applicable to GHGs. In September 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency EPA issued a final rule establishing a system for mandatory reporting of GHG emissions. In November 2010, the EPA expanded
the reach of its GHG reporting requirements to include the petroleum and natural gas industries. Petroleum and natural
gas facilities subject to the rule, which include facilities of our natural gas distribution and electricity generation
businesses, are required to begin emissions monitoring in January 2011 and to submit detailed annual reports beginning
in March 2012. The rule does not require affected facilities to implement GHG emission controls or reductions. In
December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of GHGs constitute an endangerment to public health and
the environment. These findings allow the EPA to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs
under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. Accordingly, the EPA has proposed two sets of regulations that would
limit GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and that would impose permit requirements for GHG emissions from certain
stationary sources. Legal challenges have been filed against many of EPA s rulemakings, and we are unable to predict
the results of those challenges.

It is expected that climate change legislation will continue to be part of the legislative and
regulatory discussion for the foreseeable future. Increased regulation of GHG emissions, especially
in the transportation sector, could impose significant additional costs on us and our customers.
The impact of legislation and regulations on us will depend on a number of factors, including (i)
what industry sectors would be impacted, (ii) the timing of required compliance, (iii) the overall
GHG emissions cap level, (iv) the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources, and (v)
the costs and opportunities associated with compliance. At this time, we cannot predict the effect
that climate change regulation may have on our business, financial condition or results of
operations in the future.

We are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance. 

Our business operations in the U.S. 

We may be unable to timely respond to changes within the energy and utility sectors that may
result from regulatory initiatives to further increase competition within our industry. Such
regulatory initiatives may create opportunities for additional competitors to enter our markets
and, as a result, we may be unable to maintain our revenues or continue to pursue our current
business strategy.

Our net income will decrease if we are required to incur additional costs to comply with new
governmental safety, health, transportation, tax and environmental regulations. 

We are subject to extensive and changing international, federal, state and local safety,
health, transportation, tax and environmental laws and regulations governing the storage,
distribution and transportation of our energy products.

New regulations, or a change in the interpretation of existing regulations, could result in
increased expenditures. In addition, for many of our operations, we are required to obtain permits
from regulatory authorities. Failure to obtain or comply with these permits or applicable laws
could result in civil and criminal fines or the cessation of the operations in violation.
Governmental regulations and policies in the United States and Europe may provide for subsidies or
incentives to customers who use alternative fuels instead of carbon fuels. These subsidies and
incentives may result in reduced demand for our energy products and services.

We are investigating and remediating contamination at a number of present and former operating
sites in the U.S., including former sites where we or our former subsidiaries operated manufactured
gas plants. Costs we incur to remediate
sites outside of Pennsylvania cannot currently be recovered in PUC rate proceedings, and
insurance may not cover all or even part of these costs. Our actual costs to clean up these sites
may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as:

the discovery of presently unknown conditions;

changes in environmental laws and regulations;

judicial rejection of our legal defenses to the third-party claims; or

the insolvency of other responsible parties at the sites at which we are involved.

In addition, if we discover additional contaminated sites, we could be required to incur
material costs, which would reduce our net income.

Our international operations could result in increased risks which may negatively affect our
business results. 

We currently operate LPG distribution businesses in Europe through our subsidiaries, Antargaz,
Flaga and Kosan Gas and we continue to explore the expansion of our international businesses.","['I donÃ¢ÂÂt also want to dwell on the reasons as many were specific to fiscal year 2011.

 Commitments and Contingencies 

Environmental Matters 

From the late 1800s through the mid-1900s, UGI Utilities and its former subsidiaries owned
and operated a number of manufactured gas plants MGPs prior to the general availability
of natural gas. Some constituents of coal tars and other residues of the manufactured gas
process are today considered hazardous substances under the Superfund Law and may be present
on the sites of former MGPs. Pursuant to the requirements of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, by the early 1950s UGI Utilities divested all of its utility
operations other than certain Pennsylvania operations, including those which now constitute
UGI Gas and Electric Utility.

UGI Utilities does not expect its costs for investigation and remediation of hazardous
substances at Pennsylvania MGP sites to be material to its results of operations because UGI
Gas is currently permitted to include in rates, through future base rate proceedings, a
five-year average of such prudently incurred remediation costs. At December 31, 2010,
neither the undiscounted nor the accrued liability for environmental investigation and
cleanup costs for UGI Gas was material.

UGI Utilities has been notified of several sites outside Pennsylvania on which private
parties allege MGPs were formerly owned or operated by it or owned or operated by its former
subsidiaries. Such parties are investigating the extent of environmental contamination or
performing environmental remediation. UGI Utilities is currently litigating three claims
against it relating to out-of-state sites.

Management believes that under applicable law UGI Utilities should not be liable in those
instances in which a former subsidiary owned or operated an MGP. There could be, however,
significant future costs of an uncertain amount associated with environmental damage caused
by MGPs outside Pennsylvania that UGI Utilities directly operated, or that were owned or
operated by former subsidiaries of UGI Utilities if a court were to conclude that (1) the
subsidiary s separate corporate form should be disregarded or (2) UGI Utilities should be
considered to have been an operator because of its conduct with respect to its subsidiary s
MGP.

South Carolina Electric Gas Company v. UGI Utilities, Inc . In April 2003, Citizens
Communications Company, now known as Frontier Communications Company Frontier ), served a
complaint naming UGI Utilities as a third-party defendant in a civil action pending in the
United States District Court for the District of Maine. In that action, the City of Bangor,
Maine City sued Frontier to recover environmental response costs associated with MGP
wastes generated at a plant allegedly operated by Frontier s predecessors at a site on the
Penobscot River. Frontier subsequently joined UGI Utilities and ten other third-party
defendants alleging that the third-party defendants are responsible for an equitable share
of any costs Frontier would be required to pay to the City for cleaning up tar deposits in
the Penobscot River. KeySpan believes that UGI Utilities is
responsible for approximately 50 of these costs as a result of UGI Utilities alleged
direct ownership and operation of the plant from 1885 to 1902. By letter dated June 6, 2006,
KeySpan reported that the New York Department of Environmental Conservation has approved a
remedy for the site that is estimated to cost approximately
 10. KeySpan believes that the cost could be as high as 20. The Northeast
Companies have appealed the decision. With respect to Waterbury North, the Northeast
Companies are expected to complete additional environmental investigations in early 2011. A
second phase of the trial is scheduled for August 2011 to determine what, if any,
contamination at Waterbury North is related to UGI Utilities period of operation. The
Northeast Companies previously estimated that remediation costs at Waterbury North could
total 25.

AmeriGas OLP Saranac Lake. By letter dated March 6, 2008, the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation DEC notified AmeriGas OLP that DEC had placed property owned
by the Partnership in Saranac Lake, New York on its Registry of Inactive Hazardous Waste
Disposal Sites. A site characterization study performed by DEC disclosed contamination
related to former MGP operations on the site. The
Partnership has communicated the results of its research to DEC and is awaiting a response
before doing any additional investigation. Because of the preliminary nature of available
environmental information, the ultimate amount of expected clean up costs cannot be
reasonably estimated.

Other Matters

Purported AmeriGas Class Action Lawsuits. On May 27, 2009, the General Partner was named as
a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of
California in which plaintiffs are challenging AmeriGas OLP s weight disclosure with regard
to its portable propane grill cylinders. As a result of the decision, during the
three-month period ended December 31, 2010 the Company reversed its previously recorded
nontaxable accrual for this matter which increased net income by 9.4. This amount is
reflected in other income, net, on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income.

We cannot predict with certainty the final results of any of the environmental or other
pending claims or legal actions described above. However, it is reasonably possible that
some of them could be resolved unfavorably to us and result in losses in excess of recorded
amounts. However, we caution you that actual results almost always vary from
assumed facts or bases, and the differences between actual results and assumed facts or bases can
be material, depending on the circumstances. When considering forward-looking statements, you
should keep in mind the following important factors which could affect our future results and could
cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements:
(1) adverse weather conditions resulting in reduced demand; (2) cost volatility and availability of
propane and other LPG, oil, electricity, and natural gas and the capacity to transport product to
our customers; (3) changes in domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including safety, tax and
accounting matters; (4) inability to timely recover costs through utility rate proceedings; (5) the
impact of pending and future legal proceedings; (6) competitive pressures from the same and
alternative energy sources; (7) failure to acquire new customers thereby reducing or limiting any
increase in revenues; (8) liability for environmental claims; (9) increased customer conservation
measures due to high energy prices and improvements in energy efficiency and technology resulting
in reduced demand; (10) adverse labor relations; (11) large customer, counterparty or supplier
defaults; (12) liability in excess of insurance coverage for personal injury and property damage
arising from explosions and other catastrophic events, including acts of terrorism, resulting from
operating hazards and risks incidental to generating and distributing electricity and transporting,
storing and distributing natural gas and LPG; (13) political, regulatory and economic conditions in
the United States and in foreign countries, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,
particularly the euro; (14) capital market conditions, including reduced access to capital markets
and interest rate fluctuations; (15) changes in commodity market prices resulting in significantly
higher cash collateral requirements; (16) reduced distributions from subsidiaries; and (17) the
timing of development of Marcellus Shale gas production; and (18) the timing and success of our
acquisitions, commercial initiatives and investments to grow our businesses.

These factors, and those factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, are not necessarily all of the important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our
forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to
update publicly any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information or future
events except as required by the federal securities laws.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following analyses compare our results of operations for the three months ended December 31,
2010 2010 three-month period with the three months ended December 31, 2009 2009 three-month
period ). Our analyses of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the segment
information included in Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Executive Overview 

Because most of our businesses sell energy products used in large part for heating purposes, our
results are significantly influenced by temperatures in our service territories, particularly
during the peak-heating season months of October through March. As a result, our earnings are
generally higher in our first and second fiscal quarters.

We recorded net income attributable to UGI Corporation of 113.1 million for the 2010 three-month
period compared to net income attributable to UGI Corporation of 98.4 million in the prior-year
three-month period. The current-year three-month period includes net income of 9.4 million from
the reversal at Antargaz of a nontaxable reserve associated with the French Competition Authority
Matter (see Note 9 to condensed consolidated financial statements). Our 2010 three-month period net
income attributable to UGI Corporation also includes greater net income from our Gas Utility
reflecting the benefits of colder weather and slightly lower operating and administrative expenses.
Weather in our International Propane operations was much colder than in the prior-year three-month
period. The colder weather and the effects of acquisitions made by Flaga during late Fiscal 2010
and early Fiscal 2011 increased International Propane LPG retail volumes sold. The benefits to net
income from the greater International Propane retail gallons sold, however, were offset in large
. We undertake no obligation to
update publicly any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information or future
events except as required by the federal securities laws.

Environmental Matters 

From the late 1800s through the mid-1900s, UGI Utilities and its former subsidiaries owned
and operated a number of manufactured gas plants MGPs prior to the general availability
of natural gas. Some constituents of coal tars and other residues of the manufactured gas
process are today considered hazardous substances under the Superfund Law and may be present
on the sites of former MGPs. Pursuant to the
requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, by the early 1950s UGI
Utilities divested all of its utility operations other than certain Pennsylvania operations,
including those which now constitute UGI Gas and Electric Utility.

UGI Utilities does not expect its costs for investigation and remediation of hazardous
substances at Pennsylvania MGP sites to be material to its results of operations because UGI
Gas is currently permitted to include in rates, through future base rate proceedings, a
five-year average of such prudently incurred remediation costs. At March 31, 2011, neither
the undiscounted nor the accrued liability for environmental investigation and cleanup costs
for UGI Gas was material.

UGI Utilities has been notified of several sites outside Pennsylvania on which private
parties allege MGPs were formerly owned or operated by it or owned or operated by its former
subsidiaries. Such parties are investigating the extent of environmental contamination or
performing environmental remediation. UGI Utilities is currently litigating two claims
against it relating to out-of-state sites.

Management believes that under applicable law UGI Utilities should not be liable in those
instances in which a former subsidiary owned or operated an MGP. There could be, however,
significant future costs of an uncertain amount associated with environmental damage caused
by MGPs outside Pennsylvania that UGI Utilities directly operated, or that were owned or
operated by former subsidiaries of UGI Utilities if a court were to conclude that (1) the
subsidiary s separate corporate form should be disregarded or (2) UGI Utilities should be
considered to have been an operator because of its conduct with respect to its subsidiary s
MGP.

South Carolina Electric Gas Company v. UGI Utilities, Inc . In April 2003, Citizens
Communications Company, now known as Frontier Communications Company Frontier ), served a
complaint naming UGI Utilities as a third-party defendant in a civil action pending in the
United States District Court for the District of Maine. In that action, the City of Bangor,
Maine City sued Frontier to recover environmental response costs associated with MGP
wastes generated at a plant allegedly operated by Frontier s predecessors at a site on the
Penobscot River. Frontier subsequently joined UGI Utilities
and ten other third-party defendants alleging that they are responsible for an equitable
share of any clean up costs Frontier would be required to pay to the City. KeySpan believes that UGI Utilities is
responsible for approximately 50 of these costs as a result of UGI Utilities alleged
direct ownership and operation of the plant from 1885 to 1902. By letter dated June 6, 2006,
KeySpan reported that the New York Department of Environmental Conservation has approved a
remedy for the site that is estimated to cost approximately 10. KeySpan believes that the
cost could be as high as 20. The Northeast Companies previously
estimated that remediation costs at Waterbury North could total 25.

AmeriGas OLP Saranac Lake. By letter dated March 6, 2008, the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation DEC notified AmeriGas OLP that DEC had placed property owned
by the Partnership in Saranac Lake, New York on its Registry of Inactive Hazardous Waste
Disposal Sites. A site characterization study performed by DEC disclosed contamination
related to former MGP operations on the site. The Partnership
has reviewed the preliminary site characterization study
prepared by the DEC, the extent of contamination and the possible existence of other
potentially responsible parties. The Partnership has communicated the results of its
research to DEC and is awaiting a response before doing any additional investigation.
Because of the preliminary nature of available environmental information, the ultimate
amount of expected clean up costs cannot be reasonably estimated.

Other Matters

Purported AmeriGas Class Action Lawsuits. On May 27, 2009, the General Partner was named as
a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of
California in which plaintiffs challenged AmeriGas OLP s weight disclosure with regard to
its portable propane grill cylinders. As a result of the decision, during the three-month period
ended December 31, 2010 the Company reversed its previously recorded nontaxable accrual for
this matter which increased net income by 9.4. This amount is reflected in other income,
net, on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the six
months ended March 31, 2011.

We cannot predict with certainty the final results of any of the environmental or other
pending claims or legal actions described above. However, it is reasonably possible that
some of them could be resolved unfavorably to us and result in losses in excess of recorded
amounts. However, we caution you that actual results almost always vary from
assumed facts or bases, and the differences between actual results and assumed facts or bases can
be material, depending on the circumstances. When considering forward-looking statements, you
should keep in mind the following important factors which could affect our future results and could
cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements:
(1) adverse weather conditions resulting in reduced demand; (2) cost volatility and availability of
propane and other LPG, oil, electricity, and natural gas and the capacity to transport product to
our customers; (3) changes in domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including safety, tax and
accounting matters; (4) inability to timely recover costs through utility rate proceedings; (5) the
impact of pending and future legal proceedings; (6) competitive pressures from the same and
alternative energy sources; (7) failure to acquire new customers thereby reducing or limiting any
increase in revenues; (8) liability for environmental claims; (9) increased customer conservation
measures due to high energy prices and improvements in energy efficiency and technology resulting
in reduced demand; (10) adverse labor relations; (11) large customer, counterparty or supplier
defaults; (12) liability in excess of insurance coverage for personal injury and property damage
arising from explosions and other catastrophic events, including acts of terrorism, resulting from
operating hazards and risks incidental to generating and distributing electricity and transporting,
storing and distributing natural gas and LPG; (13) political, regulatory and economic conditions in
the United States and in foreign countries, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,
particularly the euro; (14) capital market conditions, including reduced access to capital markets
and interest rate fluctuations; (15) changes in commodity market prices resulting in significantly
higher cash collateral requirements; (16) reduced distributions from subsidiaries; (17) the timing
of development of Marcellus Shale gas production; and (18) the timing and success of our
acquisitions, commercial initiatives and investments to grow our businesses.

These factors, and those factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, are not necessarily all of the important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our
forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to
update publicly any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information or future
events except as required by the federal securities laws.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following analyses compare our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011 2011 three-month period with the three months ended March 31, 2010 2010 three-month period and the six months ended March 31, 2011 2011 six-month period with the six months ended March
31, 2010 2010 six-month period ). Our analyses of results of operations should be read in
conjunction with the segment information included in Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements.

Executive Overview 

Because most of our businesses sell energy products used in large part for heating purposes, our
results are significantly influenced by temperatures in our service territories, particularly
during the peak-heating season months of October through March. As a result, our earnings are
generally higher in our first and second fiscal quarters.

We recorded net income attributable to UGI Corporation of 149.4 million for the 2011 three-month
period compared to net income attributable to UGI Corporation of 157.1 million in the prior-year
three-month period. Results in the 2011 three-month period include a 5.2 million after-tax loss
associated with AmeriGas Partners early extinguishment of Senior Notes while net income
attributable to UGI Corporation in the 2010 three-month period includes a 3.3 million after-tax
loss from the Partnership s discontinuance of interest rate hedges.

Our 2011 three-month period net income attributable to UGI Corporation includes greater net income
from our Gas Utility principally reflecting the benefits of colder weather and an improving
economy. However, in our International Propane operations, significantly warmer weather and the
continuing effects of higher LPG commodity prices on customer usage decreased Antargaz volumes
sold and total margin. Average temperatures in our AmeriGas Propane service territory during the
2011 three-month period were slightly colder than normal and the prior year. However, lower retail
volumes resulting from the effects of significantly warmer weather in our southern regions during
February and March and customer conservation reduced AmeriGas Propane s total margin. Midstream 
Marketing s contribution to net income attributable to UGI Corporation was modestly higher than the
prior year as greater contributions from retail power marketing, peaking and asset management
activities, and tax benefits associated with solar energy projects were offset in large . We undertake no obligation to
update publicly any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information or future
events except as required by the federal securities laws.

30, 2010 2010 nine-month period ). Our analyses of results of operations should be read in
conjunction with the segment information included in Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial

Executive Overview 

Because most of our businesses sell energy products used in large part for heating purposes, our
results are significantly influenced by temperatures in our service territories, particularly
during the peak-heating season months of October through March. As a result, our earnings are
generally higher in our first and second fiscal quarters.

We recorded a net loss attributable to UGI Corporation of (7.2) million for the 2011 three-month
period compared to net income attributable to UGI Corporation of 3.4 million in the prior-year
three-month period. Our 2011 three-month period net loss attributable to UGI Corporation includes
greater seasonal losses from our International Propane operations reflecting the adverse effects of
significantly warmer than normal late winter and spring weather and the adverse impact of
continuing high LPG commodity prices on customer usage. Average temperatures in our Antargaz
service territory were approximately 47 warmer than normal in the 2011 three-month period. The
decline in the 2011 three-month period International Propane results was partially offset by
modestly higher net income from our Gas Utility, principally resulting from greater total margin on
higher volumes, and a slightly lower seasonal net loss from AmeriGas Propane reflecting higher
total margin on increased retail sales. Results in the 2011
nine-month period include a 5.2 million after-tax loss associated with AmeriGas Partners February
2011 extinguishment of Senior Notes while net income attributable to UGI Corporation in the
2010 nine-month period includes a 3.3 million after-tax loss from the discontinuance of
Partnership interest rate hedges. The 2011 nine-month period also reflects net income of 9.4
million from the reversal at Antargaz of a nontaxable reserve associated with the French
Competition Authority Matter (see Note 10 to condensed consolidated financial statements).

UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Our 2011 nine-month period net income attributable to UGI Corporation primarily reflects greater
net income from our Gas Utility principally the result of colder 2011-period weather and an
improving economy. However this increase was more than offset principally by lower net income
attributable to UGI Corporation from our International Propane and AmeriGas Propane operations. The
2011 nine-month period weather at Antargaz was warmer than the prior-year nine-month period
reflecting significantly warmer late winter and spring weather which resulted in an early end to
the heating season. In addition, average unit margins at Antargaz, primarily during the first
quarter of Fiscal 2011, were negatively impacted by rapidly rising LPG product costs. AmeriGas
Propane net income attributable to UGI Corporation was lower in the 2011 nine-month period
principally reflecting the effects on volumes of significantly warmer early fall weather and, in
our southern regions, significantly warmer late winter weather. The effects of these weather
patterns and continued customer conservation, and the impact on the prior-year volumes of a strong
crop-drying season, resulted in an overall decline in retail volumes sold. Midstream Marketing s
contribution to net income attributable to UGI Corporation was slightly above the prior-year
nine-month period as greater contributions principally from retail power marketing, winter peaking
and asset management activities, and tax benefits associated with solar energy projects, were
largely offset by the absence of earnings from Atlantic Energy and lower contribution from our
electricity generation assets. Variance is not meaningful.

Environmental Matters 

From the late 1800s through the mid-1900s, UGI Utilities and its former subsidiaries owned
and operated a number of manufactured gas plants MGPs prior to the general availability
of natural gas. Some constituents of coal tars and other residues of the manufactured gas
process are today considered hazardous substances under the Superfund Law and may be present
on the sites of former MGPs. Pursuant to the requirements of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, by the early 1950s UGI Utilities divested all of its utility
operations other than certain Pennsylvania operations, including those which now constitute
UGI Gas and Electric Utility.

UGI Utilities does not expect its costs for investigation and remediation of hazardous
substances at Pennsylvania MGP sites to be material to its results of operations because UGI
Gas is currently permitted to include in rates, through future base rate proceedings, a
five-year average of such prudently incurred remediation costs. At June 30, 2011, neither
the undiscounted nor the accrued liability for environmental investigation and cleanup costs
for UGI Gas was material.

UGI Utilities has been notified of several sites outside Pennsylvania on which private
parties allege MGPs were formerly owned or operated by it or owned or operated by its former
subsidiaries. Such parties are investigating the extent of environmental contamination or
performing environmental remediation. UGI Utilities is currently litigating two claims
against it relating to out-of-state sites.

Management believes that under applicable law UGI Utilities should not be liable in those
instances in which a former subsidiary owned or operated an MGP. There could be, however,
significant future costs of an uncertain amount associated with environmental damage caused
by MGPs outside Pennsylvania that UGI Utilities directly operated, or that were owned or
operated by former subsidiaries of UGI Utilities if a court were to conclude that (1) the
subsidiary s separate corporate form should be disregarded or (2) UGI Utilities should be
considered to have been an operator because of its conduct with respect to its subsidiary s
MGP.

South Carolina Electric Gas Company v. UGI Utilities, Inc . In April 2003, Citizens
Communications Company, now known as Frontier Communications Company Frontier ), served a
complaint naming UGI Utilities as a third-party defendant in a civil action pending in the
United States District Court for the District of Maine. In that action, the City of Bangor,
Maine City sued Frontier to recover environmental response costs associated with MGP
wastes generated at a plant allegedly operated by Frontier s predecessors at a site on the
Penobscot River. Frontier subsequently joined UGI Utilities and ten other third-party
defendants alleging that they are responsible for an equitable share of any clean up costs
Frontier would be required to pay to the City. KeySpan believes that UGI Utilities is
responsible for approximately 50 of these costs as a result of UGI Utilities alleged
direct ownership and operation of the plant from 1885 to 1902. By letter dated June 6, 2006,
KeySpan reported that the New York Department of Environmental Conservation has approved a
remedy for the site that is estimated to cost approximately 10. KeySpan believes that the
cost could be as high as 20. A second phase of the trial is scheduled for August 2011 to determine what,
if any, contamination at Waterbury North is related to UGI Utilities period of operation.
The Northeast Companies previously estimated that remediation costs at Waterbury North could
total 25.

Disposal Sites. A site characterization study performed by DEC disclosed contamination
related to former MGP operations on the site. The
Partnership has communicated the results of its research to DEC and is awaiting a response

ended December 31, 2010 the Company reversed its previously recorded nontaxable accrual for
this matter which increased net income by 9.4. This amount is reflected in other income,
net, on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income.

We cannot
predict the final results of any of the environmental or other
pending claims or legal actions described above. However, it is reasonably possible that
some of them could be resolved unfavorably to us and result in losses in excess of recorded
amounts. However, we caution you that actual results almost always vary from
assumed facts or bases, and the differences between actual results and assumed facts or bases can
be material, depending on the circumstances. When considering forward-looking statements, you
should keep in mind the following important factors which could affect our future results and could
cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements:
(1) adverse weather conditions resulting in reduced demand; (2) cost volatility and availability of
propane and other LPG, oil, electricity, and natural gas and the capacity to transport product to
our customers; (3) changes in domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including safety, tax and
accounting matters; (4) inability to timely recover costs through utility rate proceedings; (5) the
impact of pending and future legal proceedings; (6) competitive pressures from the same and
alternative energy sources; (7) failure to acquire new customers thereby reducing or limiting any
increase in revenues; (8) liability for environmental claims; (9) increased customer conservation
measures due to high energy prices and improvements in energy efficiency and technology resulting
in reduced demand; (10) adverse labor relations; (11) large customer, counterparty or supplier
defaults; (12) liability in excess of insurance coverage for personal injury and property damage
arising from explosions and other catastrophic events, including acts of terrorism, resulting from
operating hazards and risks incidental to generating and distributing electricity and transporting,
storing and distributing natural gas and LPG; (13) political, regulatory and economic conditions in
the United States and in foreign countries, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,
particularly the euro; (14) capital market conditions, including reduced access to capital markets
and interest rate fluctuations; (15) changes in commodity market prices resulting in significantly
higher cash collateral requirements; (16) reduced distributions from subsidiaries; (17) the timing
of development of Marcellus Shale gas production; and (18) the timing and success of our
acquisitions, commercial initiatives and investments to grow our businesses.

These factors, and those factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, are not necessarily all of the important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our
forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to
update publicly any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information or future
events except as required by the federal securities laws.

UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following analyses compare our results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2011 2011 three-month period with the three months ended June 30, 2010 2010 three-month period and the nine months ended June 30, 2011 2011 nine-month period with the nine months ended June
30, 2010 2010 nine-month period ). Our analyses of results of operations should be read in
conjunction with the segment information included in Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements.

Executive Overview 

Because most of our businesses sell energy products used in large part for heating purposes, our
results are significantly influenced by temperatures in our service territories, particularly
during the peak-heating season months of October through March. As a result, our earnings are
generally higher in our first and second fiscal quarters.

We recorded a net loss attributable to UGI Corporation of (7.2) million for the 2011 three-month
period compared to net income attributable to UGI Corporation of 3.4 million in the prior-year
three-month period. Our 2011 three-month period net loss attributable to UGI Corporation includes
greater seasonal losses from our International Propane operations reflecting the adverse effects of
significantly warmer than normal late winter and spring weather and the adverse impact of
continuing high LPG commodity prices on customer usage. Average temperatures in our Antargaz
service territory were approximately 47 warmer than normal in the 2011 three-month period. The
decline in the 2011 three-month period International Propane results was partially offset by
modestly higher net income from our Gas Utility, principally resulting from greater total margin on
higher volumes, and a slightly lower seasonal net loss from AmeriGas Propane reflecting higher
total margin on increased retail sales. Results in the 2011
nine-month period include a 5.2 million after-tax loss associated with AmeriGas Partners February
2011 extinguishment of Senior Notes while net income attributable to UGI Corporation in the
2010 nine-month period includes a 3.3 million after-tax loss from the discontinuance of
Partnership interest rate hedges. The 2011 nine-month period also reflects net income of 9.4
million from the reversal at Antargaz of a nontaxable reserve associated with the French
Competition Authority Matter (see Note 10 to condensed consolidated financial statements).

UGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Our 2011 nine-month period net income attributable to UGI Corporation primarily reflects greater
net income from our Gas Utility principally the result of colder 2011-period weather and an
improving economy. However this increase was more than offset principally by lower net income
attributable to UGI Corporation from our International Propane and AmeriGas Propane operations. The
2011 nine-month period weather at Antargaz was warmer than the prior-year nine-month period
reflecting significantly warmer late winter and spring weather which resulted in an early end to
the heating season. In addition, average unit margins at Antargaz, primarily during the first
quarter of Fiscal 2011, were negatively impacted by rapidly rising LPG product costs. AmeriGas
Propane net income attributable to UGI Corporation was lower in the 2011 nine-month period
principally reflecting the effects on volumes of significantly warmer early fall weather and, in
our southern regions, significantly warmer late winter weather. The effects of these weather
patterns and continued customer conservation, and the impact on the prior-year volumes of a strong
crop-drying season, resulted in an overall decline in retail volumes sold. Midstream Marketing s
contribution to net income attributable to UGI Corporation was slightly above the prior-year
nine-month period as greater contributions principally from retail power marketing, winter peaking
and asset management activities, and tax benefits associated with solar energy projects, were
largely offset by the absence of earnings from Atlantic Energy and lower contribution from our
electricity generation assets. Variance is not meaningful.

"While UNIFI attempts to mitigate the impacts of such rising costs through increased operational efficiencies and increased selling prices, inflation could become a factor that negatively impacts UNIFI s profitability. 
 Environmental Matters 
 UNIFI is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations limiting the use, storage, handling, release, discharge and disposal of a variety of hazardous substances and wastes used in or resulting from its operations (and to potential remediation obligations thereunder). These laws include the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (including provisions relating to underground storage tanks) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly referred to as Superfund or CERCLA, and various state counterparts to such laws. UNIFI s operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations issued thereunder, which, among other things, establish 
 11 
 
 exposure standards regarding hazardous materials and noise standards, and regulate the use of hazardous chemicals in the workplace. 
 UNIFI believes that it has obtained, and is in compliance in all material respects with, all significant permits required to be issued by federal, state or local law in connection with the operation of its business. UNIFI also believes that the operation of its production facilities and its disposal of waste materials are substantially in compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and that there are no material ongoing or anticipated capital expenditures associated with environmental control facilities necessary to remain in compliance with such provisions. UNIFI incurs normal operating costs associated with the discharge of materials into the environment, but does not believe that these costs are material or inconsistent with those of its domestic competitors. Since 1993, DuPont has been investigating and cleaning up the Kinston site under the supervision of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality DEQ pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action program. The program requires DuPont to identify all potential areas of environmental concern AOCs ), assess the extent of containment at the identified AOCs and remediate the AOCs to comply with applicable regulatory standards. Effective March 20, 2008, UNIFI entered into a lease termination agreement associated with conveyance of certain assets at the Kinston site to DuPont. This agreement terminated the Ground Lease and relieved UNIFI of any future responsibility for environmental remediation, other than participation with DuPont, if so called upon, with regard to UNIFI s period of operation of the Kinston site, which was from 2004 to 2008. At this time, UNIFI has no basis to determine if or when it will have any responsibility or obligation with respect to the AOCs or the extent of any potential liability for the same. This site has been remediated by DuPont, and DuPont has received authority from DEQ to discontinue further remediation, other than natural attenuation. Prior to transfer of responsibility to UNIFI, DuPont has a duty to monitor and report the environmental status of the site to DEQ. UNIFI expects to assume that responsibility in fiscal 2018 and will be entitled to receive from DuPont seven years of monitoring and reporting costs, less certain adjustments. 
 To appropriately leverage the significant investments made in machinery and equipment in recent years, UNIFI expects to make additional investments in certain growth initiatives, including commercial expansion; technology and innovation; strategic partnerships; and people and teams. When executed with synergy, these initiatives are expected to increase the returns from UNIFI s core competencies by utilizing a premier supply chain and state-of-the-art equipment to deliver technology-driven solutions backed by innovation and sustainability to like-minded customers worldwide. These initiatives are expected to increase net sales, gross margins and operating income while causing SG A expenses to increase correspondingly. The most significant investment was the completion of our REPREVE Bottle Processing Center at UNIFI s existing facility in Reidsville, North Carolina. This bottle processing plant is expected to process 75 million pounds of plastic bottle flake annually, in support of our growing focus on recycling and sustainability, especially with the REPREVE brand and its expanding portfolio.

 To appropriately leverage the significant investments made in machinery and equipment in recent years, UNIFI expects to make additional investments in certain growth initiatives, including commercial expansion; technology and innovation; strategic partnerships; and people and teams. When executed with synergy, these initiatives are expected to increase the returns from UNIFI s core competencies by utilizing a premier supply chain and state-of-the-art equipment to deliver technology-driven solutions backed by innovation and sustainability to like-minded customers worldwide. These initiatives are expected to increase net sales, gross margins and operating income while causing SG A expenses to increase correspondingly. The most significant investment was the completion of our REPREVE Bottle Processing Center at UNIFI s existing facility in Reidsville, North Carolina. This bottle processing plant is expected to process 75 million pounds of plastic bottle flake annually, in support of our growing focus on recycling and sustainability, especially with the REPREVE brand and its expanding portfolio.

 Environmental Matters 
 UNIFI is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations limiting the use, storage, handling, release, discharge and disposal of a variety of hazardous substances and wastes used in or resulting from its operations (and to potential remediation obligations thereunder). These laws include the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (including provisions relating to underground storage tanks) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly referred to as Superfund or CERCLA, and various state counterparts to such laws. UNIFI s operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations issued thereunder, which, among other things, establish 
 11 
 
 exposure standards regarding hazardous materials and noise standards, and regulate the use of hazardous chemicals in the workplace. 
 UNIFI believes that it has obtained, and is in compliance in all material respects with, all significant permits required to be issued by federal, state or local law in connection with the operation of its business. UNIFI also believes that the operation of its production facilities and its disposal of waste materials are substantially in compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and that there are no material ongoing or anticipated capital expenditures associated with environmental control facilities necessary to remain in compliance with such provisions. UNIFI incurs normal operating costs associated with the discharge of materials into the environment, but does not believe that these costs are material or inconsistent with those of its domestic competitors. Since 1993, DuPont has been investigating and cleaning up the Kinston site under the supervision of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality DEQ pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action program. The program requires DuPont to identify all potential areas of environmental concern AOCs ), assess the extent of containment at the identified AOCs and remediate the AOCs to comply with applicable regulatory standards. Effective March 20, 2008, UNIFI entered into a lease termination agreement associated with conveyance of certain assets at the Kinston site to DuPont. This agreement terminated the Ground Lease and relieved UNIFI of any future responsibility for environmental remediation, other than participation with DuPont, if so called upon, with regard to UNIFI s period of operation of the Kinston site, which was from 2004 to 2008. At this time, UNIFI has no basis to determine if or when it will have any responsibility or obligation with respect to the AOCs or the extent of any potential liability for the same. This site has been remediated by DuPont, and DuPont has received authority from DEQ to discontinue further remediation, other than natural attenuation. Prior to transfer of responsibility to UNIFI, DuPont has a duty to monitor and report the environmental status of the site to DEQ. UNIFI expects to assume that responsibility in fiscal 2018 and will be entitled to receive from DuPont seven years of monitoring and reporting costs, less certain adjustments.","[""Despite this persistent conditions, we were able to generate overall revenue growth of 1.2% as polyester grew 3.6% but was partially offset by a 5.9% decline in the Nylon segment. \nIt's worth noting that the full effect of 3 major hurricanes in the quarter was a definite headwind that required diligence to manage through.

"Any significant change in natural gas prices has a material affect on our revenues, cash flow and the value of our oil, liquids and natural gas reserves. Generally, prices and demand for
domestic natural gas are influenced by weather conditions, supply imbalances and by world wide oil price levels. Domestic oil prices are primarily influenced by world oil market developments. Currently we plan to participate in drilling an estimated 280 gross wells in 2008 and estimate our total capital expenditures for oil and natural gas exploration to be approximately 360.0 million, excluding
acquisitions. Whether we are able to drill the full number of wells we are planning on drilling is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and include the availability of drilling rigs, prices for oil, NGLs and natural
gas, the cost to drill wells, the weather and the efforts of outside industry partners. On May 16, 2006, we closed the acquisition of
certain oil and natural gas properties from a group of private entities for approximately 32.4 million in cash. In 2007, oil production increased 8 and NGL production increased 78 while natural gas production decreased by 2 . Natural gas production increases were limited in the first
quarter of 2007 due to adverse weather which slowed the timing for completion of certain wells and pipeline construction delays which prevented the connection of wells that had recently been drilled and completed. Increased oil and NGL production
came primarily from our ongoing development drilling activity and from acquisitions completed in 2006.","The prices we receive for our oil, NGLs and
natural gas production have a direct impact on our revenues, profitability and cash flow as well as our ability to meet our projected financial and operational goals. The prices for natural gas and crude oil are heavily dependent on a number of
factors beyond our control, including: 

the demand for oil and/or natural gas; 

current weather conditions in the continental United States (which can greatly influence the demand for natural gas at any given time as well as the price we
receive for such natural gas); 

the amount and timing of liquid natural gas imports; and 

the ability of current distribution systems in the United States to effectively meet the demand for oil and/or natural gas at any given time, particularly in times
of peak demand which may result because of adverse weather conditions. Oil prices are extremely sensitive to foreign
influences based on political, social or economic underpinnings, any one of which could have an immediate and significant effect on the price and supply of oil . Many of our customers budgets tend to be susceptible to the influences of current price fluctuations. Other factors that affect our ability to work
our drilling rigs are: the weather which, under adverse circumstances, can delay or even cause the abandonment of a project by an operator; the competition faced by us in securing the award of a drilling contract in a given area; our experience and
recognition in a new market area; and the availability of labor to operate our drilling rigs. Uncertainty of Oil, NGLs and Natural
Gas Reserves. These factors include: 

political conditions in oil producing regions, including the Middle East, Nigeria and Venezuela; 

the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on prices and their ability to maintain production quotas;

the price of foreign oil imports; 

imports of liquefied natural gas; 

actions of governmental authorities; 

the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas; 

the level of consumer demand; 

U.S. storage levels of natural gas; 

weather conditions; 

domestic and foreign government regulations; 

the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels; and 

overall economic conditions. These
factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas. Successful acquisitions, particularly those
of oil and natural gas companies or of oil and natural gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future oil, NGLs and natural
gas prices, operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain. Numerous factors beyond our control may cause the curtailment, delay or cancellation of drilling operations,
including: 

unexpected drilling conditions; 

pressure or irregularities in formations; 

equipment failures or accidents; 

adverse weather conditions; 

compliance with governmental requirements; and 

shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or delivery crews and the delivery of equipment. Exploratory drilling is a speculative activity. The cost of
developing gathering systems and processing plants is substantial and our ability to recoup these costs is uncertain. Our operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of many things beyond our control, including: 

unexpected changes in the deliverability of natural gas reserves from the wells connected to the gathering systems; 

availability of competing pipelines in the area; 

equipment failures or accidents; 

adverse weather conditions; 

compliance with governmental requirements; 

delays in the development of other producing properties within the gathering system s area of operation; and 

demand for natural gas and its constituents. Many of the wells from which we gather and process natural gas are operated by other parties. Our operations
present inherent risks of loss that, if not insured or indemnified against, could adversely affect our results of operations. Our
drilling operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling industry, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of hole, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather.
Our exploration and production and mid-stream operations are subject to these and similar risks. Any of these events could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations,
environmental damage and damage to the property of others. Generally, drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer, and we seek to obtain indemnification from our drilling customers by
contract for some of these risks. In addition, these laws and regulations, and any others that are passed by
the jurisdictions where we have production, could limit the total number of wells drilled or the allowable production from successful wells, which could limit our revenues. We are also subject to complex environmental laws and regulations adopted by the various jurisdictions where we own or operate. We could incur liability
to governments or third parties for discharges of oil, natural gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water, including responsibility for remedial costs. Because the requirements imposed by laws and regulations are frequently changed, we cannot assure you that laws and regulations enacted in the future, including changes to existing laws and regulations, will not adversely affect our
business. In addition, because we acquire interests in properties that have been operated in the past by others, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by the former operators, which liability could be material. Any future implementation of price controls on oil, NGLs and natural gas would affect our operations. 

Certain hazards are encountered in drilling wells some of which could lead to substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities. Also, governmental
regulations or new laws relating to environmental matters could increase Partnership costs, delay or prevent drilling a well, require the Partnership to cease operations in certain areas or expose the Partnership to significant liabilities for
violations of laws and regulations. Additional Financing Additional Assessments . Recently, prices for oil and natural gas have fluctuated over
a wide range. Operating and Environmental Hazards Operating hazards such as fires, explosions, blowouts, unusual formations, formations with abnormal pressures and other unforeseen conditions are sometimes encountered in drilling wells. On occasion, substantial liabilities 
 
 12 

to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could reduce the funds available for exploration and development or result in
loss of Partnership Properties. The Partnership will attempt to maintain customary insurance coverage, but the Partnership may be subject to liability for pollution and other damages or may lose substantial portions of its properties due to hazards
against which it cannot insure or against which it may elect not to insure due to unreasonably high or prohibitive premium costs or for other reasons. The activities of the Partnership may expose it to drilling limitations and potential liability
for pollution or other damages under laws and regulations relating to environmental matters (see Government Regulation and Environmental Risks below). Competition The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. In the event that the Partnership discovers or acquires natural
gas reserves, there may be delays in commencing or continuing production due to the need for gathering and pipeline facilities, contract negotiation with the available market, pipeline capacities, seasonal takes by the gas purchaser or a surplus of
available gas reserves in a particular area.

Government Regulation and Environmental Risks The oil and gas business is subject to pervasive government regulation under which, among other things, rates of production from producing properties may be fixed and the prices for gas produced from such producing
properties may be impacted. It is possible that these regulations pertaining to rates of production could become more pervasive and stringent in the future. The activities of the Partnership may expose it to potential liability under laws and
regulations relating to environmental matters which could adversely affect the Partnership. Compliance with these laws and regulations may increase Partnership costs, delay or prevent the drilling of wells, delay or prevent the acquisition of
otherwise desirable producing oil and gas properties, require the Partnership to cease operations in certain areas, and cause delays in the production of oil and gas. Marketing of Reserves The General Partner has the authority to market the oil and gas production of the
Partnership. In this connection, it may execute on behalf of the Partnership division orders, contracts for the marketing or sale of oil, gas or other hydrocarbons or other marketing agreements. Sales of the oil and gas production of the Partnership
will be to independent third parties or to the General Partner or its affiliates (see CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ). Additionally, such proposals, if adopted, are likely to be challenged in the courts and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the outcome of any such challenge. Production and Environmental Regulation Certain states in
which the Partnership may drill and own productive properties control production from wells through regulations establishing the spacing of wells, limiting the number of days in a given month during which a well can produce and otherwise limiting
the rate of allowable production. In addition, the federal government and various state governments have adopted laws and regulations regarding protection
of the environment. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before or after drilling commences, impose requirements that increase the cost of operations, prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within
wilderness areas or other environmentally sensitive areas and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling operations, particularly operations in offshore waters or on submerged lands. A past, present, or future release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the air, water, or ground by the Partnership or as a result of disposal practices
may subject the Partnership to liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended CERCLA ), the Resource Conservation Recovery Act RCRA ), the Clean Water Act,
and/or similar state laws, and any regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. Under CERCLA and similar laws, the Partnership may be fully liable for the cleanup costs of a release of hazardous substances even though it contributed to only part of the
release. However, there can be no
assurance that such insurance coverage will always be in force or that, if in force, it will adequately cover any losses or liability the Partnership may incur. Violation of environmental legislation and regulations may result in the imposition of fines or civil or criminal penalties and, in certain circumstances, the entry of an order for the removal, remediation and abatement of the conditions,
or suspension of the activities, giving rise to the violation. The General Partner believes that the Partnership will comply with all orders and regulations applicable to its operations. However, in view of the many uncertainties with respect to the
current controls, including their duration and possible modification, the General Partner cannot predict the overall effect of such controls on such operations. Similarly, the General Partner cannot predict what future environmental laws may be
enacted or regulations may be promulgated and what, if any, impact they would have on operations or Partnership Revenue. SUMMARY OF THE

Oil
and Natural Gas 

Third
quarter 2008 production from our oil and natural gas segment was 172,000 Mcfe
per day, a 2 decrease over the second quarter of 2008 and a 13 increase over
the third quarter of 2007. The decrease from the second quarter 2008
resulted from the shut-in of approximately 400 MMcfe of production due to the
impact Hurricanes Gustav and Ike had on the infrastructure necessary for ongoing
production activity in the affected areas and curtailment due to low natural gas
prices. The increase from the third quarter 2007 resulted from production from
new wells completed throughout 2007 and during the first nine months of 2008.
Excluding the impact of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, third quarter 2008 production
would have been approximately 177,000 Mcfe per day. 

Oil
and natural gas revenues decreased 7 from the second quarter of 2008 and
increased 60 from the third quarter of 2007. Direct profit (oil and natural gas revenues less oil and
natural gas operating expense) decreased 10 from the second quarter of 2008 and
increased 67 from the third quarter of 2007. The decrease from the
second quarter 2008 resulted from the shut-in of production due to the impact of
Hurricanes Gustav and Ike combined with lower natural gas prices. The increase
from the third quarter 2007 resulted primarily from the increase in commodity
prices and, to a lesser extent, from our increased production. Operating cost
per Mcfe produced increased 5 from the second quarter of 2008 and increased 22 
from the third quarter of 2007. Excluding the impact of Hurricanes Gustav
and Ike, third quarter 2008 operating costs per Mcfe produced would have
increased 3 over the second quarter of 2008 and increased 19 over the third
quarter of 2007. We hedged 75 of our third quarter 2008 average daily oil
production and approximately 35 of our third quarter 2008 average natural gas
production in 2008 to help manage our cash flow and capital expenditure
requirements in 2008. 

Mid-Stream 

Third
quarter 2008 liquids sold per day decreased 1 from the second quarter of 2008
and increased 46 from the third quarter of 2007. Liquids sold per day decreased
from the second quarter of 2008; due to the impact Hurricanes Gustav and Ike had
on the NGL market in the Gulf Coast area extending into the Mid-continent area,
and increased from the third quarter of 2007 primarily as the result of upgrades
and expansions to existing plants. Excluding the impact of Hurricanes Gustav and
Ike, third quarter 2008 liquids sold per day would have increased 5 over the
second quarter of 2008 and increased 54 over the third quarter of 2007. Gas
processed per day increased 6 and 28 over the second quarter of 2008 and the
third quarter of 2007, respectively. 

23 

Direct
profit (mid-stream revenues less mid-stream operating expense) decreased 10 
from the second quarter of 2008 and increased 93 from the third quarter of
2007. The decrease from the second quarter 2008 resulted from reduced liquids
recoveries due to the negative impact Hurricanes Gustav and Ike had on the NGL
market, and the
increase from the third quarter 2007 resulted primarily from the combination of
both increased commodity prices and volumes processed and sold. Total operating
cost for our mid-stream segment increased less than 1 from the second quarter
of 2008 and 60 from the third quarter of 2007. As of December
31, 2007, natural gas comprised 82 of our oil, NGLs and natural gas
reserves. Any significant change in natural gas prices has a material effect on
our revenues, cash flow and the value of our oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves.
Generally, prices and demand for domestic natural gas are influenced by weather
conditions, supply imbalances and by worldwide oil price levels. Domestic oil
prices are primarily influenced by world oil market developments. Currently we
plan to participate in drilling an estimated 275 gross wells in 2008 and
estimate our associated total capital expenditures will be approximately 438.0
million, excluding acquisitions. Whether and if we are able to drill the full
number of planned wells is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are
beyond our control and include the availability of drilling rigs, prices for
oil, NGLs and natural gas, the cost to drill wells, the weather, changes to our
anticipated cash flow and the efforts of outside industry partners. Commodity
prices have decreased during the third quarter of 2008, and may continue to
decrease or remain at their current lower levels for an indeterminable period of
time beyond 2008.",,"[""Third quarter was a very good operating and financial quarter for all the units businesses and for our shareholders.

,"The world supply of leaf tobacco at any given time is a function of current tobacco production, inventories held by manufacturers, and the volumes of uncommitted stocks of processed tobacco held by leaf tobacco merchants from prior years production. Production of tobacco in a given year may be significantly affected by such factors as: 

weather and natural disasters, including any adverse weather conditions that may result from climate change, 

crop infestation and disease, 

availability of crop inputs, 

volume of annual tobacco plantings and yields realized by farmers, 

farmer elections to grow crops other than tobacco, 

elimination of government subsidies to farmers, and 

demographic shifts that change the number of farmers or the amount of land available to grow tobacco. 

Any significant change in these factors could cause a material imbalance in the supply of and demand for tobacco, which would affect our results of operations. 

Our financial results, particularly our year-over-year quarterly comparisons, may be significantly affected by variations in tobacco growing seasons and fluctuations in crop sizes. The timing of the cultivation and delivery of tobacco is dependent upon a number of factors, including weather and other natural events, and our processing schedules and results of operations can be significantly altered by these factors. In addition, the potential impact of climate change is uncertain and may vary by geographic region. The possible effects, as described in various public accounts, could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels that could adversely impact our costs and business operations and the supply and demand for leaf tobacco. Our operations also rely on dependable and efficient transportation services. A disruption in transportation services, as a result of climate change or otherwise, may also significantly impact our results of operations. 

Further, the timing and unpredictability of customer orders and shipments may require us to keep tobacco in inventory or otherwise increase our risk and may also result in variations in quarterly and annual financial results. Unless we receive marketable tobacco that meets the quality and quantity specifications of our customers, we bear the risk that we will not be able to fully recover our crop advances or recover them in a reasonable period of time. 

Weather and other conditions can affect the marketability of our products. 

Tobacco crops are subject to vagaries of weather and the environment that can, in some cases, change the quality or size of the crops. If a weather event is particularly severe, such as a major drought or hurricane, the affected crop could be destroyed or damaged to an extent that it would be less desirable to manufacturers, which would result in a reduction in revenues. If such an event is also widespread, it could affect our ability to acquire the quantity of products required by our customers. Shifts in customer demand from one type of tobacco to another could create sourcing difficulties as requirements move from one origin to another. 

In addition, continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues, including climate change, conservation, and natural resource management, could result in new or more stringent forms of regulatory oversight of industry activities, which may lead to increased levels of expenditures for environmental controls, land use restrictions affecting us or our suppliers, and other conditions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, certain aspects of our business generate carbon emissions. Regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions have been proposed. These may include limitations on such emissions, taxes or emission allowance fees on such emissions, various restrictions on industrial operations, and other measures that could affect land-use decisions, the cost of agricultural production, and the cost and means of processing and transporting our products. These actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.","['Bryan, and in the United States, itÃ¢ÂÂs flat with a normal crop.

 Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters 
 Due to the nature of Spectrum Brands operations, its facilities are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign legal and regulatory provisions relating to the environment, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances at Spectrum Brands facilities. Spectrum Brands believes that compliance with the federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations to which it is subject will not have a material effect upon Spectrum Brands capital expenditures, financial condition, earnings or competitive position. 
 From time to time, Spectrum Brands has been required to address the effect of historic activities on the environmental condition of its properties. Spectrum Brands has not conducted invasive testing at all facilities to identify all potential environmental liability risks. Given the age of its facilities and the nature of its operations, it is possible that material liabilities may arise in the future in connection with Spectrum Brands current or former facilities. 
 Spectrum Brands has been, and in the future may be, subject to proceedings related to its disposal of industrial and hazardous material at off-site disposal locations or similar disposals made by other parties for which Spectrum Brands is held responsible as a result of its relationships with such other parties. In the U.S., these proceedings are under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA or similar state laws that hold persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of such substances strictly liable for costs incurred in responding to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances from such sites, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original disposal. Liability under CERCLA is typically joint and several, meaning that a liable party may be responsible for all costs incurred in investigating and remediating contamination at a site. Spectrum Brands may be named as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or similar state laws for other sites not currently known to it, and the costs and liabilities associated with these sites may be material. 
 It is difficult to quantify with certainty the potential financial impact of actions regarding expenditures for environmental matters, particularly remediation, and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment. See Note 21 , Commitments and Contingencies , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for further details on estimated liabilities arising from such environmental matters. Nevertheless, based upon the information currently available, Spectrum Brands believes that its ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters should not be material to its business or financial condition. 
 Electronic and electrical products that Spectrum Brands sells in Europe, particularly products sold under the Remington brand name, VARTA battery chargers, certain portable lighting and all of Spectrum Brands batteries, are subject to regulation in European Union EU markets under three key EU directives. Spectrum Brands will continue to evaluate the impact of the Battery Directive and its enabling legislation. 
 Certain of Spectrum Brands products and facilities in each of its business segments are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA and the United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA or other federal consumer protection and product safety agencies and are subject to the regulations such agencies enforce, as well as by similar state, foreign and multinational agencies and regulations. For example, in the U.S., all products containing pesticides must be registered with the EPA and, in many cases, similar state and foreign agencies before they can be manufactured or sold. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislation or regulation applicable to the insurance industry, FGL, its competitors or those entities with which FGL does business. Legislative or regulatory requirements imposed by or promulgated in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act may impact FGL in many ways, including, but not limited to: 
 
 placing FGL at a competitive disadvantage relative to FGL s competition or other financial services entities; 
 
 25 

 Table of Contents 

changing the competitive landscape of the financial services sector or the insurance industry; 
 
 making it more expensive for FGL to conduct its business; 
 
 requiring the reallocation of significant company resources to government affairs; 
 
 increasing FGL s legal and compliance related activities and the costs associated therewith; or 
 
 otherwise having a material adverse effect on the overall business climate as well as FGL s financial condition and results of operations. 
 Until various studies are completed and final regulations are promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on investments, investment activities and insurance and annuity products of FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance remains unclear. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Spectrum Brands Business- Spectrum Brands international operations may expose Spectrum Brands to risks related to compliance with the laws and regulations of foreign countries in this report. 
 Moreover, there are adopted and proposed international accords and treaties, as well as federal, state and local laws and regulations that would attempt to control or limit the causes of climate change, including the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. In the event that the U.S. government or foreign governments enact new climate change laws or regulations or make changes to existing laws or regulations, compliance with applicable laws or regulations may result in increased manufacturing costs for Spectrum Brands products, such as by requiring investment in new pollution control equipment or changing the ways in which certain of its products are made. Spectrum Brands may incur some of these costs directly and others may be passed on to it from its third-party suppliers. Although Spectrum Brands believes that it is substantially in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at its facilities, Spectrum Brands may not always be in compliance with such laws and regulations or any new laws and regulations in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 From time to time, Spectrum Brands has been required to address the effect of historic activities on the environmental condition of its properties or former properties. Spectrum Brands has not conducted invasive testing at all of its facilities to identify all potential environmental liability risks. Given the age of its facilities and the nature of its operations, material liabilities may arise in the future in connection with its current or former facilities. Spectrum Brands is currently engaged in investigative or remedial projects at a few of its facilities and any liabilities arising from such investigative or remedial projects at such facilities may have a material effect on Spectrum Brands business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Table of Contents 

In addition, in connection with certain business acquisitions, Spectrum Brands has assumed, and in connection with future acquisitions may assume in the future, certain potential environmental liabilities. To the extent Spectrum Brands has not identified such environmental liabilities or to the extent the indemnifications obtained from Spectrum Brands counterparties are insufficient to cover such environmental liabilities, these environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands business. 
 Spectrum Brands is also subject to proceedings related to its disposal of industrial and hazardous material at off-site disposal locations or similar disposals made by other parties for which it is responsible as a result of its relationship with such other parties. Spectrum Brands may be named as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or similar state or foreign jurisdiction laws in the future for other sites not currently known to Spectrum Brands, and the costs and liabilities associated with these sites may have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 It is difficult to quantify with certainty the potential financial impact of actions regarding expenditures for environmental matters, particularly remediation, and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment. See Note 21 , Commitments and Contingencies , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion on estimated liabilities arising from such environmental matters. Nevertheless, based upon the information currently available, Spectrum Brands believes that its ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters should not be material to Spectrum Brands business or financial condition. 
 Compliance with various public health, consumer protection and other regulations applicable to Spectrum Brands products and facilities could increase its cost of doing business and expose Spectrum Brands to additional requirements with which Spectrum Brands may be unable to comply. Spectrum Brands cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the EPA s continuing evaluations of active ingredients used in its products. 
 In addition, the use of certain pesticide products that are sold through Spectrum Brands Home and Garden Business may, among other things, be regulated by various local, state, federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may require that only certified or professional users apply the product, that users post notices on properties where products have 
 
 49 

 Table of Contents 

been or will be applied or that certain ingredients may not be used. Compliance with such public health regulations could increase Spectrum Brands cost of doing business and expose Spectrum Brands to additional requirements with which it may be unable to comply. 
 Any failure to comply with these laws or regulations, or the terms of applicable environmental permits, could result in Spectrum Brands incurring substantial costs, including fines, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions or the prohibition of sales of its pest control products. Environmental law requirements, and the enforcement thereof, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and could require Spectrum Brands to incur significant expenses.

Commitments and contingencies We are involved
 in various litigations, claims and administrative proceedings,
 including environmental matters, arising in the normal course of
 business. We have recorded reserves in the financial statements
 related to these matters which are developed based on
 consultation with legal counsel and internal and external
 consultants and engineers, depending on the nature of the
 reserve. We provide for environmental accruals when, in
 conjunction with our internal and external counsel, we determine
 that a liability is both probable and estimable. Factors that
 affect the recorded amount of any liability in the future
 include: our participation percentage due to a settlement by or
 bankruptcy of other potentially responsible parties; a change in
 the environmental laws requiring more stringent requirements; a
 change in the estimate of future costs that will be incurred to
 remediate the site; and changes in technology related to
 environmental remediation. We have property and casualty
 insurance to cover such liabilities, but there is no guarantee
 that the coverage will be sufficient.

We have accrued liabilities for product liability claims,
 workers compensation matters and product warranty issues.
 We have recorded liabilities in our financial statements related
 to these matters, which are developed using input derived from
 actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience
 data depending on the nature of the accrued liability.","We cannot assure you that we will be able to
 retain all of our current senior management personnel and to
 attract and retain other personnel, including qualified
 mechanics and engineers, necessary for the development of our
 business. The loss of the services of senior management and
 other key personnel or the failure to attract additional
 personnel as required could have a material and adverse effect
 on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Environmental
 compliance costs and liabilities could affect our financial
 condition, results of operations and cash flows
 adversely. 

Our operations and properties are subject to stringent
 U.S. and foreign, federal, state and local laws and
 regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws
 and regulations governing the investigation and clean up of
 contaminated properties as well as air emissions, water
 discharges, waste management and disposal and workplace health
 and safety. Such laws and regulations affect a significant
 percentage of our operations, are continually changing, are
 different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines
 and sanctions for violations. Further, they may require
 substantial
 clean-up 
 costs for our properties (many of which are sites of
 long-standing manufacturing operations) and the installation of
 costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to
 limit pollution emissions
 and/or 
 decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance
 releases. We must conform our operations and properties to these
 laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions
 as these requirements change.

We routinely deal with natural gas, oil and other petroleum
 products. As a result of our fabrication and aftermarket parts
 and services operations, we generate, manage and dispose of, or
 recycle, hazardous wastes and substances such as solvents,
 thinner, waste paint, waste oil, washdown wastes and sandblast
 material. Hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes
 may have been disposed or released on, under or from properties
 owned, leased or operated by us or on, under or from other
 locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for
 disposal. These properties may be subject to investigatory,
 clean-up and
 monitoring requirements under U.S. and foreign, federal,
 state and local environmental laws and regulations. Such
 liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the
 original actions and without regard to whether we knew of, or
 were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic
 substances, and such liability may be joint and several with
 other parties. If the liability is joint and several, we could
 be responsible for payment of the full amount of the liability,
 whether or not any other responsible party also is liable.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, both
 operating and capital costs to comply with environmental laws
 and regulations, including the
 clean-up and
 investigation of some of our properties as well as offsite
 disposal locations. In addition, although we believe our
 operations are in compliance with environmental laws and
 regulations and that we will be indemnified by Ingersoll Rand
 for certain contamination and compliance costs (subject to
 certain exceptions and limitations), new laws and regulations,
 stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the
 discovery of previously unknown contamination, the imposition of
 new clean-up 
 requirements, new claims for property damage or personal injury
 arising from environmental matters, or the refusal
 and/or 
 inability of

Ingersoll Rand to meet its indemnification obligations could
 require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or
 increased liabilities that could have a material and adverse
 effect on our business, financial condition and results of
 operations.

Failure

 clients could result in the loss of future

Our U.S. In addition, press and
 other third-party announcements or rumors relating to Ingersoll
 Rand may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock

 affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Natural
 gas operations entail inherent risks that may result in
 substantial liability to us. 

We supply products to the natural gas industry, which is subject
 to inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and
 failures and natural disasters resulting in uncontrollable flows
 of gas or well fluids, fires and explosions. These risks may
 expose our clients to liability for personal injury, wrongful
 death, property damage, pollution and other environmental
 damage. We also may become involved in litigation related to
 such matters.","[""This compares to $21.3 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the corresponding period in 2007.\nWe are showing on this slide the impact of several unusual items from both periods.

"In the
 downstream refining market, an industry source estimated the
 addition of approximately 9 million barrels of daily
 production worldwide during the next five years. The forces
 propelling this movement are the increasing demand for refined
 products, the need to meet more stringent environmental
 requirements and the desire to process a greater amount of sour
 crude feedstock. These estimates could be revised as a result of
 market changes.

Total revenues. As a
 percentage of revenues, cost of sales was 71.1 for the three
 months ended September 30, 2008, compared to 74.7 for the
 three months ended September 30, 2007. See comment below in
 Gross Profit regarding the effects of recent
 hurricanes in the U.S. and the work stoppage at our Painted
 Post facility in 2007.

Gross profit. As a
 percentage of revenues, gross profit was 28.9 for the three
 months ended September 30, 2008, compared to 25.3 for the
 three months ended September 30, 2007, principally from the
 effect of higher revenues on relatively fixed costs and the
 following factors. We estimate that a late September accident at
 our Painted Post facility and the impact from Hurricanes Ike and
 Gustav reduced the Company s gross profit for deferred
 revenue and higher costs during the three months ended
 September 30, 2008, by approximately 5. Also, the
 represented employees at our Painted Post facility imposed a
 work stoppage on August 3, 2007, at the conclusion of the
 existing collective bargaining agreement as we were unsuccessful
 in reaching a new agreement. These increases are principally due
 to higher revenues. We estimate that a late September accident
 at our Painted Post facility and the impact from Hurricanes Ike
 and Gustav reduced this segment s gross profit from
 deferred revenue and higher costs during the three months ended
 September 30, 2008, by approximately 2 to 3. Also, the
 represented employees at our Painted Post facility imposed a
 work stoppage on August 3, 2007, at the conclusion of the
 existing collective bargaining agreement as we were unsuccessful
 in reaching a new agreement. Gross
 profit, as a percentage of segment revenues, increased to 40.7 
 in 2008 compared to 35.2 in 2007, principally from higher
 revenues and the following factors. We estimate that a late
 September accident at our Painted Post facility and the impact
 from Hurricanes Ike and Gustav reduced this segment s gross
 profit from deferred revenue and higher costs during the three
 months ended September 30, 2008, by approximately 2 to 3.
 Also, the represented employees at our Painted Post facility
 imposed a work stoppage on August 3, 2007, at the
 conclusion of the existing collective bargaining agreement as we
 were unsuccessful in reaching a new agreement. The work stoppage
 continued throughout the quarter ending September 30, 2007.
 We estimate the margins related to deferred sales and higher
 costs associated with the work stoppage reduced this
 segment s gross profit for the three months ended
 September 30, 2007, by approximately 11 to 12.

 adjustments have not been resolved as of October 29, 2008.

. In addition to the other risks described in this Risk Factors section, the following factors could cause our operating results to fluctuate: 

delays, increased costs, or other unanticipated changes in contract performance that may affect profitability, particularly with contracts that are fixed-price or have funding limits; 

seasonality of the spending cycle of our public sector clients, notably the U.S. federal government, the spending patterns of our private sector clients, and weather conditions; 

budget constraints experienced by our federal, state, and local government clients; 

our ability to integrate any companies that we acquire; 

the number and significance of client contracts commenced and completed during a quarter; 

the continuing creditworthiness and solvency of clients; 

reductions in the prices of services offered by our competitors; and 

legislative and regulatory enforcement policy changes that may affect demand for our services. 
 
 As a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Accordingly, the success and further development of our business depends, in large part, upon the continued funding of these government programs, and upon our ability to obtain contracts and perform well under these programs. There are several factors that could materially affect our government contracting business, including the following: 

uncertainty surrounding how any remaining funds are being distributed under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ARRA and into what governmental areas such funds are being used, and how much funding may remain available; 

changes in and delays or cancellations of government programs, requirements, or appropriations; 

budget constraints or policy changes resulting in delay or curtailment of expenditures related to the services we provide; 

re-competes of government contracts; 

the timing and amount of tax revenue received by federal, state, and local governments, and the overall level of government expenditures; 

curtailment in the use of government contracting firms; 

delays associated with insufficient numbers of government staff to oversee contracts; 

the increasing preference by government agencies for contracting with small and disadvantaged businesses, including the imposition of set percentages of prime and subcontracts to be awarded to such businesses for which we would not qualify; 

competing political priorities and changes in the political climate with regard to the funding or operation of the services we provide; 

the adoption of new laws or regulations affecting our contracting relationships with the federal, state, or local governments; 

a dispute with, or improper activity by, any of our subcontractors; and 

general economic or political conditions. 
 
 These and other factors could cause government agencies to delay or cancel programs, to reduce their orders under existing contracts, to exercise their rights to terminate contracts, or not to exercise contract options for renewals or extensions. If the project is delayed or canceled, we may bear the cost of an underutilized workforce that was dedicated to fulfilling the project. In addition, performance of projects can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including unavoidable delays from government inaction, public opposition, inability to obtain financing, weather conditions, unavailability of vendor materials, changes in the project scope of services requested by our clients, industrial accidents, environmental hazards, labor disruptions, and other factors. To the extent these events occur, the total costs of the project could exceed our estimates and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, incur a loss on a project, which may reduce or eliminate our overall profitability. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. 
 
 Further, acquisitions may also cause us to: 

issue securities that would dilute our current stockholders ownership percentage; 

use a substantial portion of our cash resources; 

increase our interest expense, leverage, and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition; 

assume liabilities, including environmental liabilities, for which we do not have indemnification from the former owners, as was the case in our acquisition of NV5, or have indemnification that may be subject to dispute or concerns regarding the creditworthiness of the former owners; 

record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential impairment charges; 

experience volatility in earnings due to changes in contingent consideration related to acquisition liability estimates; 

incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; 

22

lose existing or potential contracts as a result of conflict of interest issues; 

incur large and immediate write-offs; or 

become subject to litigation. 

If we are not able to successfully manage our growth strategy, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Department of Defense security regulations, as well as many other rules and regulations. In addition, we must also comply with other government regulations related to employment practices, environmental protection, health and safety, tax, accounting, and anti-fraud measures, as well as many others regulations in order to maintain our government contractor status. These laws and regulations affect how we do business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. 
 
 Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents, or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other foreign corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations. For example, the FCPA, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. For example, in the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal disputes regarding personal injury claims, employee or labor disputes, professional liability claims, and general commercial disputes involving project cost overruns and liquidated damages as well as other claims. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we frequently make professional judgments and recommendations about environmental and engineering conditions of project sites for our clients. We may be deemed to be responsible for these judgments and recommendations if they are later determined to be inaccurate. If we fail to meet these requirements or do not properly implement and comply with our safety program, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. 
 
 We may be subject to liabilities under environmental laws and regulations, including liabilities assumed in acquisitions for which we may not be indemnified. 
 
 We must comply with a number of laws that strictly regulate the handling, removal, treatment, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended CERCLA ), and comparable state laws, we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated hazardous materials. CERCLA and comparable state laws typically impose strict joint and several liabilities without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances. The liability for the entire cost of clean-up could be imposed upon any responsible party. Other principal federal environmental, health, and safety laws affecting us include, among others, the Resource Conversation and Recovery Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act. Our business operations may also be subject to similar state and international laws relating to environmental protection. Liabilities related to environmental contamination or human exposure to hazardous substances, or a failure to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial costs to us, including clean-up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, or cessation of remediation activities. Our continuing work in the areas governed by these laws and regulations exposes us to the risk of substantial liability. 
 
 Weather conditions and seasonal revenue fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 
 Due primarily to inclement weather conditions, which lead to project delays and slower completion of contracts, and a higher number of holidays, our operating results during December, January, February and March are generally lower in comparison to other months. As a result, our revenue and net income for the first and fourth quarters of a fiscal year may be lower than our results for the second and third quarters of a fiscal year. 
 
 Force majeure or extraordinary events beyond the control of the contracting parties, such as natural and man-made disasters as well as terrorist actions, could negatively impact the economies in which we operate by causing the closure of offices, interrupting projects, and forcing the relocation of employees. We typically remain obligated to perform our services after a terrorist action or natural disaster unless the contract contains a force majeure clause that relieves us of our contractual obligations in such an extraordinary event. If we are not able to react quickly to force majeure, our operations may be affected significantly, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

"Overview 
 
 We are a provider of professional and technical engineering and consulting solutions to public and private sector clients. We focus on the infrastructure, energy, construction, real estate, and environmental markets. We primarily focus on five business verticals - construction quality assurance, infrastructure, energy, program management, and environmental solutions. Our primary clients include U.S. (""RDK""), an established leader in the provision of energy efficiency and mechanical, electric and pluming (MEP) services based in Boston, Massachusetts. In addition to MEP and fire protection services, RDK offers commissioning services, technology design services, and energy and sustainability services, including Whole Building Energy Modeling and ASHRAE Level Energy Audits, Green Building Certification, Energy Code Consulting, Carbon Emissions Management, and Renewable Energy Management. RDK primarily serves commercial, healthcare, science and technology, education, government, and transportation clients. The aggregate purchase price paid by us is up to 4,940, paid with a combination of cash at closing and future note payments. 
 
 On April 14, 2017, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Bock Clark Corporation B C ), an Akron, Ohio based surveying, commercial zoning, and environmental services firm. We believe that the acquisition of B C will expand our cross-selling opportunities within our infrastructure engineering, surveying, and program management groups and with our financial and transactional real estate clients. 
 
 Segments . 
 
 Our service capabilities are organized into five verticals: infrastructure, engineering, and support services; construction quality assurance; program management; energy services; and environmental services. Our Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker and organized the Company into two operating and reportable segments: Infrastructure (INF), which includes our engineering, civil program management, and construction quality assurance practices; and Buildings, Energy Science (BES), which includes our energy and environmental practices as well as buildings program management.

 Revenues 
 
 We enter into contracts with our clients that contain two principal types of pricing provisions: cost-reimbursable and fixed-price. The increases during the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 includes approximately 11,133 related to acquisitions closed during both the three and six months ended July 1, 2017. The growth in revenues from BES was primarily attributable to increases in facilities program management and environmental services. 
 
 Segment Income before Taxes from BES increased 4,157 and 5,190, or 287.1 and 178.8 , respectively, during the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.",,"['Both projects represent reoccurring revenue streams for NV5.

"This increase was partially offset by a
decrease in our fragrance business of approximately 30 million.

In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, net sales increased 29 or 96.0 million to
 423.8 million primarily reflecting higher net sales from our travel retail
business, the United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, Italy and South Africa of
approximately 63 million, collectively. In continental Europe, the increase
reflects more normalized levels following a difficult prior-year period when we
experienced adverse weather conditions, lower sales orders due to a change in
fiscal year of one key customer and the renegotiation of certain trading terms
with another. We also benefited from the effect of favorable foreign currency
exchange rates to the U.S. In addition, we expect to continue to invest
in these types of spending behind both new and existing products in our fiscal
2005 second quarter.

In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, operating income increased 34.2 million to
 41.9 million primarily due to improved results from our travel retail business,
the United Kingdom, Italy, South Africa and Spain of approximately 21 million,
partially offset by lower results in France of approximately 2 million. These
results also reflect more normalized levels following a difficult prior-year
period when we experienced adverse weather conditions in continental Europe,
lower sales orders due to a change in fiscal year of one key customer and the
renegotiation of certain trading terms with another.

In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased 3.4 million to 6.3 million. This
increase reflects improved results in Hong Kong and Australia of approximately
 2 million, partially offset by a decrease in operating income of approximately
 1 million in Japan and in China, where we continue to invest in new brand
expansion and business opportunities.

a change in fiscal year of one key customer; and the renegotiation of certain

Interest Expense, Net

Net interest expense was 3.3 million as compared with 7.2 million in the
prior-year period. The decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a
 4.1 million decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the redemption
of 291.6 million aggregate principal amount of Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock due 2015 on June 10, 2004 and the reduction in the dividend rate of the

The decrease in net interest expense for fiscal year 2014 of 12.0 million resulted primarily from the refinancing transaction that occurred in February 2014, which resulted in a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on the long-term debt compared to the prior year and a decrease in amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs and original issue discount.","Our growth strategy relies in part upon new restaurant development by existing and new franchisees. We and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new restaurants, including: 
 
 availability of financing; 
 
 selection and availability of suitable restaurant locations; 
 
 competition for restaurant sites; 
 
 negotiation of acceptable lease and financing terms; 
 
 securing required domestic or foreign governmental permits and approvals; 
 
 consumer tastes in new geographic regions and acceptance of our products; 
 
 employment and training of qualified personnel; 
 
 impact of inclement weather, natural disasters, and other acts of nature; and 
 
 general economic and business conditions. 
 In particular, because the majority of our new restaurant development is funded by franchisee investment, our growth strategy is dependent on our franchisees (or prospective franchisees ability to access funds to finance such development. 
 Increases in commodity prices may negatively affect payments from our franchisees and licensees. 
 Coffee and other commodity prices are subject to substantial price fluctuations, stemming from variations in weather patterns, 
 
 - 15 - 

shifting political or economic conditions in coffee-producing countries, and delays in the supply chain. If commodity prices rise, franchisees may experience reduced sales, due to decreased consumer demand at retail prices that have been raised to offset increased commodity prices, which may reduce franchisee profitability. 
 
 Shortages of coffee or milk could adversely affect our revenues. 
 If coffee or milk consumption continues to increase worldwide or there is a disruption in the supply of coffee or milk due to natural disasters, political unrest, or other calamities, the global supply of these commodities may fail to meet demand. If coffee or milk demand is not met, franchisees may experience reduced sales which, in turn, would reduce our royalty income. The international operations of our franchisees may subject us to additional risks, which differ in each country in which our franchisees operate, and such risks may negatively affect our business or result in a delay in or loss of royalty income to us. 
 The factors impacting the international markets in which restaurants are located may include: 
 
 recessionary or expansive trends in international markets; 
 
 changes in foreign currency exchange rates and hyperinflation or deflation in the foreign countries in which we or our international joint ventures operate; 
 
 the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds; 
 
 availability of credit for our franchisees, licensees, and our international joint ventures to finance the development of new restaurants; 
 
 increases in the taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws; 
 
 legal and regulatory changes and the burdens and costs of local operators compliance with a variety of laws, including trade restrictions and tariffs; 
 
 interruption of the supply of product; 
 
 increases in anti-American sentiment and the identification of the Dunkin Donuts brand and Baskin-Robbins brand as American brands; 
 
 political and economic instability; and 
 
 natural disasters, terrorist threats and/or activities, and other calamities. 
 Any or all of these factors may reduce distributions from our international joint ventures or other international partners and/or royalty income, which in turn may materially and adversely impact our business and operating results. 
 Our and our franchisees operations and properties are subject to extensive U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental, building, and zoning requirements. Our development of properties for leasing or subleasing to franchisees depends to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic, and other regulations and requirements. Failure to comply with legal requirements could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. We may incur investigation, remediation, or other costs related to releases of hazardous materials or other environmental conditions at our properties, regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by us or a third party, such as a prior owner or tenant. We have incurred costs to address soil and groundwater contamination at some sites, and continue to incur nominal remediation costs at some of our other locations.

Franchisee Litigation. Franchisees are subject to a variety of litigation risks, including, but not limited to, customer claims, personal-injury claims, environmental claims, employee allegations of improper termination and discrimination, claims related to violations of the ADA, religious freedom, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ), and intellectual-property claims. Each of these claims may increase costs and limit the funds available to make royalty payments and reduce the execution of new franchise arrangements. Failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important personnel could lead to ineffective management and operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 
 Unforeseen weather or other events, including terrorist threats or activities, may disrupt our business. 
 Unforeseen events, including war, terrorism, and other international, regional, or local instability or conflicts (including labor issues), embargos, public health issues (including tainted food, food-borne illnesses, food tampering, or water supply or widespread/pandemic illness such as Ebola, the avian or H1N1 flu, MERS), and natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations or that of our franchisees or suppliers; or result in political or economic instability. As a result, the market price of our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the value of their stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, and could lose part or all of their investment. The price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including those described elsewhere in this report and others such as: 
 
 variations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors; 
 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results; 
 
 publication of research reports by securities analysts about us, our competitors, or our industry; 
 
 our failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market; 
 
 additions and departures of key personnel; 
 
 strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments, or changes in business strategy; 
 
 - 21 - 

the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry; 
 
 speculation in the press or investment community; 
 
 changes in accounting principles; 
 
 terrorist acts, acts of war, or periods of widespread civil unrest; 
 
 natural disasters and other calamities; and 
 
 changes in general market and economic conditions. 
 As we operate in a single industry, we are especially vulnerable to these factors to the extent that they affect our industry, our products, or to a lesser extent our markets.","['We missed for the year for our guidance by 15 stores, where there are a couple of things here and there that impacted that?

 Self-insurance liabilities : The Company is generally self-insured for product liability, environmental liability and medical and workers compensation claims. For product liability, catastrophic insurance coverage is retained for potentially significant individual claims. In addition, favorable foreign currency movements of 2.8 million improved gross profit during 2015. The overall improvement in the Americas gross profit was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing variances, mainly due to the transition from the old plant to the new plant in Brazil and weather-related U.S. plant shutdowns during the first quarter of 2015, as well as lower volumes and a shift in sales to lower-margin lift trucks. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof. Among the factors that could cause plans, actions and results to differ materially from current expectations are, without limitation: (1) reduction in demand for lift trucks, attachments and related aftermarket parts and service on a global basis, (2) the ability of dealers, suppliers and end-users to obtain financing at reasonable rates, or at all, as a result of current economic and market conditions, (3) the political and economic uncertainties in the countries where the Company does business, (4) customer acceptance of pricing, (5) delays in delivery or increases in costs, including transportation costs, of raw materials or sourced products and labor or changes in or unavailability of quality suppliers, (6) exchange rate fluctuations, changes in import tariffs and monetary policies and other changes in the regulatory climate in the countries in which the Company operates and/or sells products, (7) delays in manufacturing and delivery schedules, (8) bankruptcy of or loss of major dealers, retail customers or suppliers, (9) customer acceptance of, changes in the costs of, or delays in the development of new products, (10) introduction of new products by, or more favorable product pricing offered by, competitors, (11) product liability or other litigation, warranty claims or returns of products, (12) the effectiveness of the cost reduction programs implemented globally, including the successful implementation of procurement and sourcing initiatives, (13) changes mandated by federal, state and other regulation, including tax, health, safety or environmental legislation, (14) the successful commercialization of Nuvera's technology, (15) the successful integration of Bolzoni s operations and employees, and (16) unfavorable effects of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union on global operations.

 Self-insurance liabilities : The Company is generally self-insured for product liability, environmental liability and medical and workers compensation claims. For product liability, catastrophic insurance coverage is retained for potentially significant individual claims. In addition, favorable foreign currency movements of 2.8 million improved gross profit during 2015. The overall improvement in the Americas gross profit was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing variances, mainly due to the transition from the old plant to the new plant in Brazil and weather-related U.S. plant shutdowns during the first quarter of 2015, as well as lower volumes and a shift in sales to lower-margin lift trucks. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof. Among the factors that could cause plans, actions and results to differ materially from current expectations are, without limitation: (1) reduction in demand for lift trucks, attachments and related aftermarket parts and service on a global basis, (2) the ability of dealers, suppliers and end-users to obtain financing at reasonable rates, or at all, as a result of current economic and market conditions, (3) the political and economic uncertainties in the countries where the Company does business, (4) customer acceptance of pricing, (5) delays in delivery or increases in costs, including transportation costs, of raw materials or sourced products and labor or changes in or unavailability of quality suppliers, (6) exchange rate fluctuations, changes in import tariffs and monetary policies and other changes in the regulatory climate in the countries in which the Company operates and/or sells products, (7) delays in manufacturing and delivery schedules, (8) bankruptcy of or loss of major dealers, retail customers or suppliers, (9) customer acceptance of, changes in the costs of, or delays in the development of new products, (10) introduction of new products by, or more favorable product pricing offered by, competitors, (11) product liability or other litigation, warranty claims or returns of products, (12) the effectiveness of the cost reduction programs implemented globally, including the successful implementation of procurement and sourcing initiatives, (13) changes mandated by federal, state and other regulation, including tax, health, safety or environmental legislation, (14) the successful commercialization of Nuvera's technology, (15) the successful integration of Bolzoni s operations and employees, and (16) unfavorable effects of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union on global operations.

 Actual liabilities relating to environmental matters may exceed the Company's expectations. 
 The Company's manufacturing operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances. If the Company fails to comply with these laws or the Company's environmental permits, then the Company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, future changes to environmental laws could require the Company to incur significant additional expenses or restrict operations. 
 The Company's products may also be subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing vehicle exhausts.

vehicles, such as industrial lift trucks. These regulations require the Company and other lift truck manufacturers to incur costs to modify designs and manufacturing processes and to perform additional testing and reporting. While the Company is not currently aware that any material outstanding claims or obligations exist with regard to these sites, the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant cleanup costs that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. 
 In connection with any acquisition the Company has made, it could, under some circumstances, be held financially liable for or suffer other adverse effects due to environmental violations or contamination caused by prior owners of businesses the Company acquired. In addition, under some of the agreements through which the Company has sold businesses or assets, it has retained responsibility for certain contingent environmental liabilities arising from pre-closing operations. These liabilities may not arise, if at all, until years later and could require the Company to incur significant additional expenses, which could materially adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition.","[""Yes.

Seasonality and Other Factors That Affect Our Business 

Our operating results are subject to annual and seasonal fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors, including: 

seasonal variations in retail demand for boats, with a significant majority of sales occurring during peak boating season, which we attempt to manage by providing incentive programs and floor plan subsidies to encourage dealer purchases throughout the year; 

product mix, which is driven by boat model mix and higher option order rates; while sales of all of our boats generate comparable margins, sales of larger boats and boats with optional content produce higher absolute profits; 

inclement weather, which can affect production at our manufacturing facility as well as consumer demand; 

competition from other performance sports boat manufacturers; 

general economic conditions; and 

foreign currency exchange rates.

Key Performance Measures 

From time to time we use certain key performance measures in evaluating our business and results of operations and we may refer to one or more of these key performance measures in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

We will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least 1 billion (as indexed for inflation), (ii) June 30, 2021, which is the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of completion of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined under the Exchange Act. 

Inflation 

The market prices of certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products, especially resins that are made with hydrocarbon feedstocks, copper, aluminum, and stainless steel, can be volatile. Historically, however, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations. 

In circumstances where we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an

operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. 2012- 02, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment , which allows us to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets is necessary, similar in approach to goodwill impairment testing. These qualitative factors include macroeconomics, adverse changes in legal and regulatory environment, loss of key customer or vendor, change in key management, and adverse changes in business climate. We recorded no impairment related to our indefinite-lived intangible asset through 2016 and 2015, as a result of the qualitative assessment.","Our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to: 

seasonal consumer demand for our products; 

discretionary spending habits; 

changes in pricing in, or the availability of supply in, the used powerboat market; 

failure to maintain a premium brand image; 

disruption in the operation of our manufacturing facilities; 

variations in the timing and volume of our sales; 

the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future sales; 

sales promotions by us and our competitors; 

changes in competitive and economic conditions generally;

impact of unfavorable weather conditions; 

changes in the cost or availability of our labor; and

increased fuel prices. 

Due to these and other factors, our results of operations may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products. We anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future. 

Unfavorable weather conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, especially during the peak boating season. 

Adverse weather conditions in any year in any particular geographic region may adversely affect sales in that region, especially during the peak boating season. Sales of our products are generally stronger just before and during spring and summer, which represent the peak boating months in most of our markets, and favorable weather during these months generally has a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, reduced rainfall levels, or drought conditions during these periods may close area boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient, thereby generally reducing consumer demand for our products. Our annual results would be materially and adversely affected if our net sales were to fall below expected seasonal levels during these periods. We may also experience more pronounced seasonal fluctuation in net sales in the future as we continue to expand our businesses. Additionally, to the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise, our sales may be affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced. There can be no assurance that weather conditions will not have a material effect on the sales of any of our products. 

We depend on our network of independent dealers, face increasing competition for dealers, and have little control over their activities.

embrace golf: (1) sizeable middle class population; (2) educational infrastructure; (3) places to play and practice; (4) professional success that inspires the local golfers; and (5) corporate support. 

We believe the golf industry is mainly driven by golfer demographics, dedicated golfers and weather and economic conditions. 

Golfer Demographics. We estimate that approximately 60 of these avid golfers in the United States are dedicated golfers. 

Weather Conditions. Weather conditions determine the number of playable days in a year and thus influence the amount of time people spend on golf. Weather conditions in most parts of the world, including our primary geographic markets, generally restrict golf from being played year round, with many of our on course customers closed during the cold weather months. Therefore, favorable weather conditions generally result in more playable days in a given year and thus more golf rounds played, which generally results in increased demand for all golf products. 

Economic Conditions. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of golf products when economic conditions are favorable and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous. 

Our Opportunity 

We have demonstrated sustained, resilient and stable revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth over the past four years, despite challenges related to demographic, macroeconomic and weather related conditions. Our differentiated focus on performance and quality excellence, enduring connections with dedicated golfers and favorable and market differentiating mix of consumable and durable products have been the key drivers of our strong performance. Our headwear seeks to deliver benefits such as moisture management, UV protections, a secure fit and durability. We offer many unique product models within our headwear lines that include fitted headwear, adjustable headwear, visors and weather protection, including waterproof and cold weather styles.

FootJoy Golf Wear 

FootJoy is one of golf s leading performance wear brands, which consists collectively of golf shoes, gloves and apparel. We are the global leader in golf shoes with approximately one third of the 2016 global wholesale golf shoe market, which we estimate was approximately 575 million. 

The golf shoe category is one of the most demanding of all wearables as golf shoes must perform in all weather conditions, including extreme temperature and moisture exposure; be resistant to pesticides and fungicides; withstand frequent usage and extensive rounds of play; and provide consistent comfort, support and protection to the golfer in an average of over five miles in a walked round. Hence, golf shoes require extensive knowledge and expertise in foot morphology, walking and swing biomechanics, material science and application and sophisticated manufacturing and construction techniques. The brand s longer term goal is to establish itself as the #1 golf outerwear product worldwide. 

The FootJoy outerwear line is predicated on the FootJoy Layering System with three layers: base layer for moisture management, mid layer for temperature control and an outer layer for weather protection. The layer system allows for easy adjustment on the course with maximum comfort and protection. As in its successful golf shoe and glove categories, FootJoy outerwear built its leadership position in the United States by utilizing premium materials and design know how to build a complete offering of specialized products to meet the unique needs of the golfer in all weather extremes. 

FootJoy fully entered the adjacent category of general golf apparel in 2012 with a tightly focused offering for men in the U.S. Our highest raw material consumption for golf balls, in order, is polybutadiene, ionomers, zinc diacrylate (ZDA), urethane, and coatings. To mitigate risk of supply disruption of polybutadiene or ionomers, we manage inventory levels and store additional inventory during the traditional hurricane season in the United States because certain significant suppliers have in the past and may in the future be impacted by hurricanes. For polybutadiene, ZDA, urethane and coatings, we use either multiple suppliers or multiple production facilities, some with geographic separation, to reduce the risk of raw material shortages. It is expected to be available in every major golf market as a performance supplement to shoe fitting for size and width. 

Seasonality 

Weather conditions in most parts of the world, including our primary geographic markets, generally restrict golf from being played year round, with many of our on course customers closed during the cold weather months. In general, during the first quarter, we begin selling our products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season. Our fourth quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of our key markets, but can also be affected by key product launches, particularly golf clubs. This seasonality, and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as discussed above under Our Products Product Launch Cycles, as well as weather conditions. This seasonality affects sales in each of our reportable segments differently. FootJoy products generally compete on the basis of quality, performance, styling and price. 

Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission,

release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of certain materials, substances and wastes and the remediation of environmental contaminants. In the ordinary course of our manufacturing processes, we use paints, chemical solvents and other materials, and generate waste by products that are subject to these environmental laws. 

We estimate incurring future costs for past and current environmental issues relating to ongoing closure activities at the following sites: (i) our former Titleist Ball Plant 1 in Acushnet, Massachusetts, which is subject to ongoing remediation of past contamination under the oversight of the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection; (ii) our Ball Plant C in New Bedford, Massachusetts, which is subject to an ongoing investigation related to contamination that is evidently migrating from an adjacent third party facility; and (iii) investigations and cleanups at four third party disposal facilities. We do not expect that any of the future anticipated expenditures at these sites will have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We have also incurred expenses in connection with environmental compliance. Historically, the costs of environmental compliance have not had a material adverse effect upon our business. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws.

FootJoy Golf Wear 

FootJoy is one of golf s leading performance wear brands, which consists collectively of golf shoes, gloves and apparel. We are the global leader in golf shoes with approximately one third of the 2016 global wholesale golf shoe market, which we estimate was approximately 575 million.

Regulation 

The Rules of Golf 

The Rules of Golf set forth the rules of play and the rules for equipment used in the game of golf. If golf participation or the number of rounds of golf played continues to decline, sales of our products may be adversely impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Unfavorable weather conditions may impact the number of playable days and rounds played in a given year. 

Weather conditions in most parts of the world, including our primary geographic markets, generally restrict golf from being played year round, with many of our on course customers closed during the cold weather months and, to a lesser extent, during the hot weather months. Unfavorable weather conditions in our major markets, such as a particularly long winter, a cold and wet spring, or an extremely hot summer, would impact the number of playable days and rounds played in a given year, which would result in a decrease in the amount spent by golfers and golf retailers on our products, particularly with respect to consumable products such as golf balls and golf gloves, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our results in 2013 and 2014 were negatively impacted by unfavorable weather conditions in our major markets. Unusual or severe weather conditions throughout the year, such as storms or droughts or other water shortages, can negatively affect golf rounds played both during the events and afterward, as weather damaged golf courses are repaired and golfers focus on repairing the damage to their homes, businesses and communities. Consequently, sustained adverse weather conditions, especially during the warm weather months, could impact our sales, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse weather conditions may have a greater impact on us than other golf equipment companies as we have a large percentage of consumable products in our product portfolio, and the purchase of consumable products is generally more dependent on the number of rounds played in a given year.

Table of Contents 

Consumer spending habits and macroeconomic factors may affect the number of rounds of golf played and related spending on golf products. 

We rely on our manufacturing facilities in the United States, Thailand and China and assembly and distribution facilities in many of our major markets, certain of which constitute our sole manufacturing facility for a particular product category, including our joint venture facility in China where substantially all of our golf shoes are manufactured and our facility in Thailand where we manufacture the majority of our golf gloves. Because substantially all of our products are manufactured and assembled in and distributed from a few locations, our operations could be interrupted by events beyond our control, including: 

power loss or network connectivity or telecommunications failure or downtime; 

equipment failure; 

human error or accidents; 

sabotage or vandalism; 

physical or electronic security breaches; 

floods, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis or other natural disasters;

Table of Contents 

political unrest; 

labor difficulties, including work stoppages or slowdowns; 

water damage or water shortage; 

government orders and regulations; 

pandemics and other health and safety issues; and 

terrorism. 

Our manufacturing, assembly and distribution capacity is also dependent on the performance of services by third parties, including vendors, landlords and transportation providers. In addition, our suppliers may not be well capitalized and they may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us or go out of business. Furthermore, the ability of third party suppliers to timely deliver raw materials or components may be affected by events beyond their control, such as work stoppages or slowdowns, transportation issues, changes in trade or tariff laws, or significant weather and health conditions. 

The cost of raw materials and components could affect our operating results. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. The seasonality of our business could be exacerbated by the adverse effects of unusual or severe weather conditions as well as by severe weather conditions caused or exacerbated by climate change. 

Our business and results of operations are also subject to fluctuations based on the timing of new product introductions. In addition to the uncertainty and the foreign currency risks discussed above under Our operations are conducted worldwide and our results of operations are subject to currency transaction risk and currency translation risk that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, these risks include: 

increased difficulty in protecting our intellectual property rights and trade secrets; 

unexpected government action or changes in legal, trade, tax or regulatory requirements; 

social, economic or political instability; 

the effects of any anti American sentiments on our brands or sales of our products; 

increased difficulty in ensuring compliance by employees, agents and contractors with our policies as well as with the laws of multiple jurisdictions, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and similar anti bribery and anti corruption laws, local and international environmental, health and safety laws, and increasingly complex regulations relating to the conduct of international commerce; 

increased difficulty in controlling and monitoring foreign operations from the United States, including increased difficulty in identifying and recruiting qualified personnel for its foreign operations; and 

increased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or ship services. 

Any violation of our policies or any applicable laws and regulations by our suppliers or manufacturers could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing, adversely affect our reputation or damage our brand image. The nature of our business makes it difficult to adjust quickly our manufacturing capacity if actual demand for our products exceeds or is less than forecasted demand. Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include, among others: 

changes in consumer demand for our products or the products of our competitors; 

45 

Table of Contents 

new product introductions by us or our competitors; 

failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance of our products; 

failure to anticipate consumer acceptance of new technologies; 

inability to realize revenues from booking orders; 

negative publicity associated with tours or golfers we endorse; 

unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; 

weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; 

terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of products and raw materials; 

abnormal weather pattern or extreme weather conditions including hurricanes, floods and droughts, among others, which may disrupt economic activity; and 

general economic conditions. 

If actual demand for our products exceeds the forecasted demand, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand, which could limit our sales. 

All of our major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon our complex information systems. Our information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from: 

earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters; 

46 

Table of Contents 

power loss, computer systems failure, Internet and telecommunications or data network failure; and 

hackers, computer viruses, unauthorized access, software bugs or glitches. 

Any damage or significant disruption in the operation of such systems or the failure of our information systems to perform as expected would disrupt our business, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory or product shortages which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our eCommerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands. 

Our business could be harmed by the occurrence of natural disasters or pandemic diseases. 

The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire, flood or hurricane, or the outbreak of a pandemic disease, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A natural disaster or a pandemic disease could adversely affect both the demand for our products as well as the supply of the raw materials or components used to make our products. Demand for golf products also could be negatively affected if consumers in the affected regions restrict their recreational activities and discretionary spending and as tourism to those areas declines. If our suppliers experience a significant disruption in their business as a result of a natural disaster or pandemic disease, our ability to obtain the necessary raw materials or components to make products could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the occurrence of a natural disaster or the outbreak of a pandemic disease

generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage our global operations. 

Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations and shareholders equity. 

Accounting rules require the evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Such indicators include a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate that could affect the value of an asset; general economic conditions, such as increasing Treasury rates or unexpected changes in gross domestic product growth; a change in our market shares; budget to actual performance and consistency of operations margins and capital expenditures; a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; or changes in management or key personnel. 

To test goodwill for impairment, we perform a two step test. In addition, any such proceeding, regardless of its merits, could divert management s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. 

We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which could subject us to liabilities, increase our costs or restrict our operations in the future. 

Our properties and operations are subject to a number of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, water discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. Our failure to comply with such environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring remedial or corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other actions. 

We may also be subject to liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties that we currently or previously owned or operated, even if such contamination was not caused by us, and we may face claims alleging harm to health or property or natural resource damages arising out of contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also be subject to similar liabilities and claims in connection with locations at which hazardous substances or wastes we have generated have been stored, treated, otherwise managed, or disposed. 

We use certain substances and generate certain wastes that may be deemed hazardous or toxic under environmental laws, and we from time to time have incurred, and in the future may incur, costs related to cleaning up contamination resulting from historic uses of certain of our current or former properties or our treatment, storage or disposal of wastes at facilities owned by others. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of such materials may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use, transfer or obtain financing regarding our property. Liability in many situations may be imposed not only without regard to fault, but may also be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire amount. 

Environmental conditions at or related to our current or former properties or operations, and/or the costs of complying with current or future environmental, health and safety requirements (which have become more stringent and complex over time) could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We may require additional capital in the future and we cannot give any assurance that such capital will be available at all or available on terms acceptable to us and, if it is available, additional capital raised by us may dilute holders of our common stock. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. The seasonality of our business could be exacerbated by the adverse effects of unusual or severe weather conditions as well as by severe weather conditions caused or exacerbated by climate change.

In addition, the occurrence of a natural disaster or the outbreak of a pandemic disease

generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage our global operations. 

Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations and shareholders equity. 

Accounting rules require the evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Such indicators include a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate that could affect the value of an asset; general economic conditions, such as increasing Treasury rates or unexpected changes in gross domestic product growth; a change in our market shares; budget to actual performance and consistency of operations margins and capital expenditures; a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; or changes in management or key personnel. 

To test goodwill for impairment, we perform a two step test. In addition, any such proceeding, regardless of its merits, could divert management s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. 

We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which could subject us to liabilities, increase our costs or restrict our operations in the future. 

Our properties and operations are subject to a number of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, water discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. Our failure to comply with such environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring remedial or corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other actions. 

We may also be subject to liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties that we currently or previously owned or operated, even if such contamination was not caused by us, and we may face claims alleging harm to health or property or natural resource damages arising out of contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also be subject to similar liabilities and claims in connection with locations at which hazardous substances or wastes we have generated have been stored, treated, otherwise managed, or disposed. 

We use certain substances and generate certain wastes that may be deemed hazardous or toxic under environmental laws, and we from time to time have incurred, and in the future may incur, costs related to cleaning up contamination resulting from historic uses of certain of our current or former properties or our treatment, storage or disposal of wastes at facilities owned by others. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of such materials may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use, transfer or obtain financing regarding our property. Liability in many situations may be imposed not only without regard to fault, but may also be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire amount. 

Environmental conditions at or related to our current or former properties or operations, and/or the costs of complying with current or future environmental, health and safety requirements (which have become more stringent and complex over time) could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We may require additional capital in the future and we cannot give any assurance that such capital will be available at all or available on terms acceptable to us and, if it is available, additional capital raised by us may dilute holders of our common stock. We also believe dedicated golfers account for an outsize share of golf equipment and gear spending outside the United States and purchase a significant portion of the golf wear products worldwide. 

We have demonstrated sustained, resilient and stable revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth over the past three years, despite challenges related to demographic, macroeconomic and weather related conditions. Our differentiated focus on performance and quality excellence, enduring connections with dedicated golfers, and favorable and market differentiating mix of consumable and durable products have been the key drivers of our strong financial performance. The demand for golf related products in general, and golf balls in particular, is directly related to the number of golf participants and the number of rounds of golf being played by these participants. 

Weather Conditions 

Weather conditions in most parts of the world, including our primary geographic markets, generally restrict golf from being played year round, with many of our on course customers closed during the cold weather months and, to a lesser extent, during the hot weather months. Unfavorable weather conditions in our major markets, such as a particularly long winter, a cold and wet spring, or an extremely hot summer, would reduce the number of playable days and rounds played in a given year, which would result in a decrease in the amount spent by golfers and golf retailers on our products, particularly with respect to consumable products such as golf balls and golf gloves. Our results in 2014 were negatively impacted by unfavorable weather conditions in our major markets. Unusual or severe weather conditions throughout the year, such as storms or droughts or other water shortages, can negatively affect golf rounds played both during the events and afterward, as weather damaged golf courses are repaired and golfers focus on repairing the damage to their homes, businesses and communities. Consequently, sustained adverse weather conditions, especially during the warm weather months, could impact our sales. Adverse weather conditions may have a greater impact on us than other golf equipment companies as we have a large percentage of consumable products in our product portfolio, and the purchase of consumable products are more dependent on the number of rounds played in a given year. 

Economic Conditions 

Our products are recreational in nature and are therefore discretionary purchases for consumers. In such case, sales of our products could be negatively impacted. 

Seasonality 

Weather conditions in most parts of the world, including our primary geographic markets, generally restrict golf from being played year round, with many of our on course customers closed during the cold weather months. In general, during the first quarter, we begin selling our products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season. Our fourth quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of our key markets, but can also be affected by key product launches, particularly golf clubs. This seasonality, and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including weather conditions as discussed above under Weather Conditions and the timing of new product introductions as discussed below under Cyclicality. This seasonality affects sales in each of our reportable segments differently.","If golf participation or the number of rounds of golf played continues to decline, sales of our products may be adversely impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Unfavorable weather conditions may impact the number of playable days and rounds played in a given year.

Consumer spending habits and macroeconomic factors may affect the number of rounds of golf played and related spending on golf products. 

We rely on our manufacturing facilities in the United States, Thailand and China and assembly and distribution facilities in many of our major markets, certain of which constitute our sole manufacturing facility for a particular product category, including our joint venture facility in China where substantially all of our golf shoes are manufactured and our facility in Thailand where we manufacture the majority of our golf gloves. Because substantially all of our products are manufactured and assembled in and distributed from a few locations, our operations could be interrupted by events beyond our control, including: 

power loss or network connectivity or telecommunications failure or downtime; 

equipment failure; 

human error or accidents; 

sabotage or vandalism; 

physical or electronic security breaches; 

floods, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis or other natural disasters;

Table of Contents 

political unrest; 

labor difficulties, including work stoppages or slowdowns; 

water damage or water shortage; 

government orders and regulations; 

pandemics and other health and safety issues; and 

terrorism. 

Our manufacturing, assembly and distribution capacity is also dependent on the performance of services by third parties, including vendors, landlords and transportation providers. In addition, our suppliers may not be well capitalized and they may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us or go out of business. Furthermore, the ability of third party suppliers to timely deliver raw materials or components may be affected by events beyond their control, such as work stoppages or slowdowns, transportation issues, changes in trade or tariff laws, or significant weather and health conditions. 

The cost of raw materials and components could affect our operating results. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. The seasonality of our business could be exacerbated by the adverse effects of unusual or severe weather conditions as well as by severe weather conditions caused or exacerbated by climate change. 

Our business and results of operations are also subject to fluctuations based on the timing of new product introductions. In addition to the uncertainty and the foreign currency risks discussed above under Our operations are conducted worldwide and our results of operations are subject to currency transaction risk and currency translation risk that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, these risks include: 

increased difficulty in protecting our intellectual property rights and trade secrets; 

unexpected government action or changes in legal, trade, tax or regulatory requirements; 

social, economic or political instability; 

the effects of any anti American sentiments on our brands or sales of our products; 

increased difficulty in ensuring compliance by employees, agents and contractors with our policies as well as with the laws of multiple jurisdictions, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and similar anti bribery and anti corruption laws, local and international environmental, health and safety laws, and increasingly complex regulations relating to the conduct of international commerce; 

increased difficulty in controlling and monitoring foreign operations from the United States, including increased difficulty in identifying and recruiting qualified personnel for its foreign operations; and 

increased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or ship services. 

Any violation of our policies or any applicable laws and regulations by our suppliers or manufacturers could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing, adversely affect our reputation or damage our brand image. The nature of our business makes it difficult to adjust quickly our manufacturing capacity if actual demand for our products exceeds or is less than forecasted demand. Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include, among others: 

changes in consumer demand for our products or the products of our competitors; 

45 

Table of Contents 

new product introductions by us or our competitors; 

failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance of our products; 

failure to anticipate consumer acceptance of new technologies; 

inability to realize revenues from booking orders; 

negative publicity associated with tours or golfers we endorse; 

unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; 

weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; 

terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of products and raw materials; 

abnormal weather pattern or extreme weather conditions including hurricanes, floods and droughts, among others, which may disrupt economic activity; and 

general economic conditions. 

If actual demand for our products exceeds the forecasted demand, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand, which could limit our sales. 

All of our major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon our complex information systems. Our information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from: 

earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters; 

46 

Table of Contents 

power loss, computer systems failure, Internet and telecommunications or data network failure; and 

hackers, computer viruses, unauthorized access, software bugs or glitches. 

Any damage or significant disruption in the operation of such systems or the failure of our information systems to perform as expected would disrupt our business, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory or product shortages which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our eCommerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands. 

Our business could be harmed by the occurrence of natural disasters or pandemic diseases. 

The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire, flood or hurricane, or the outbreak of a pandemic disease, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A natural disaster or a pandemic disease could adversely affect both the demand for our products as well as the supply of the raw materials or components used to make our products. Demand for golf products also could be negatively affected if consumers in the affected regions restrict their recreational activities and discretionary spending and as tourism to those areas declines. If our suppliers experience a significant disruption in their business as a result of a natural disaster or pandemic disease, our ability to obtain the necessary raw materials or components to make products could be materially adversely affected.

This decrease in net sales in the United States was due to a decrease of 8.3 million in net sales of Titleist golf clubs, a decrease of 7.6 million in net sales of Titleist golf balls and a decrease of 4.9 million in net sales of FootJoy golf wear, slightly offset by an increase of 1.2 million in net sales of Titleist golf gear. Net sales in the United States were impacted by a reduced store count as a result of the retail channel disruptions in 2016 as well as unfavorable weather conditions which negatively impacted both rounds of play and golf club fitting and trial activities. 

Our sales in regions outside of the United States decreased by 14.0 million, or 2.4 , to 578.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to 592.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by a sales volume decline of our performance golf ball models which were in their second year of the two-year product life cycle and was partially offset by a sales volume increase of our newly introduced Pro V1 and Pro V1x golf balls. In the United States, sales volumes were impacted by a reduced store count as a result of the retail channel disruptions in 2016, unfavorable weather conditions, which negatively impacted rounds of play, as well as increased competitive promotional activity in the marketplace. 

Titleist golf balls segment operating income decreased by 5.9 million, or 8.4 , to 63.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to 69.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by lower sales volumes of wedges, which were in their second model year, and prior generation irons. In the United States, sales volumes were impacted by a reduced store count as a result of the retail channel disruptions in 2016 as well as unfavorable weather conditions which negatively impacted golf club fitting and trial activities. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in average selling prices, in particular our latest model drivers and fairways.","[""Acushnet's golf ball business has also been impacted by wet weather in 2017, which has caused year-to-date rounds declines in the key markets of New England, mid-Atlantic and the Pacific. We are encouraged, however, by national rounds increases in August and September, which occurred in spite of sharp declines in the Southeast and Texas, resulting from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, where golf, understandably, took a backseat in these regions as the focus shifted to cleanup and recovery, which has progressed well for most of our affected trade partners.

 Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation and Reclassification of Common Stock 
 At December 31, 2015, the Company was authorized to issue 18,333,333 shares of Common Stock, 0.0001 par value per share (""Common Stock""), of which 15,000,000 shares were designated as Class A Common Voting Shares (""Class A Common Stock"") and 3,333,333 were designated as Class B Common Non-Voting Shares (""Class B Common Stock""). Each modeling assumption or un-modeled risk introduces uncertainty into PML estimates that management must consider. These uncertainties can include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
 The models do not address all the possible hazard characteristics of a catastrophe peril (e.g., the precise path and wind speed of a hurricane); 
 
 The models may not accurately reflect the true frequency of events; 
 
 The models may not accurately reflect a risk s vulnerability or susceptibility to damage for a given event characteristic; 
 
 The models may not accurately represent loss potential to insurance or reinsurance contract coverage limits, terms and conditions; and 
 
 The models may not accurately reflect the impact on the economy of the area affected or the financial, judicial, political, or regulatory impact on insurance claim payments during or following a catastrophe event. 
 Our PMLs are reviewed by management after the assessment of outputs from multiple third-party vendor models and other qualitative and quantitative assessments, including exposures not typically modeled in vendor models. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. 
 In addition, we design our policy terms to manage our exposure to expanding theories of legal liability like those which have given rise to claims for lead paint, asbestos, mold, construction defects and environmental matters. Many of the policies we issue also include conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims to us and entitle us to decline coverage in the event of a violation of those conditions. These types of governmental actions could result in higher than anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. Three examples of unanticipated risks that have affected the insurance industry are: 
 
 Asbestos liability applied to manufacturers of products and contractors who installed those products. The U.S. federal government generally has not directly regulated the insurance industry except for certain areas of the market, such as insurance for flood, nuclear and terrorism risks. However, the federal government has undertaken initiatives or considered legislation in several areas that may affect the insurance industry, including tort reform, corporate governance and the taxation of reinsurance companies.","[""And it's also worth noting, we are still 100% surplus lines; we don't write any admitted business, which is why we don't write any workers comp. And lastly, we did have some property exposed in Hurricane Matthew. At this point, it appears that losses will come in below $1 million pretax so we feel pretty good about how the property portfolio performs.""]",negative,only_RF,treatment,16171,0.0,2.0,-0.9999995,negative,0.750629842,2.0,1.0,1.0,65.0,0.0307692307692307,0.0153846153846153,0.0153846153846153
"Forward-looking statements by their nature
address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. For us, particular uncertainties arise
from changes in the demand for our coal by the domestic electric generation industry; from
legislation and regulations relating to the Clean Air Act and other environmental initiatives; from
operational, geological, permit, labor and weather-related factors; from fluctuations in the amount
of cash we generate from operations; from future integration of acquired businesses; and from
numerous other matters of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political,
economic, business, competitive or regulatory nature. These uncertainties may cause our actual
future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements.
We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. The following table compares the number of tons we sold during the nine months

Sales volume in the Powder River Basin increased from the first nine months of 2006 to the
first nine months of 2007 due to increased sales from the Coal Creek mine and higher volumes of
brokerage activity. These increases in volume were partially offset by a decrease at the Black
Thunder mine due to the planned reductions discussed previously, as well as weather-related
shipment challenges and an unplanned belt outage in the first quarter of 2007. The Coal Creek mine
was restarted during 2006.

In the Western Bituminous region, sales volume increased during the first nine months of 2007
when compared with the first nine months of 2006, reflecting a full nine months of production at
the West Elk mine, which was idle during the first quarter of 2006 after the combustion-related
event, and at the Skyline longwall mine, which commenced mining in a new reserve area in the second
quarter of 2006. Since other companies may calculate coal sales prices per ton differently, our
calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by those companies.
Transportation costs per ton billed to customers for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 were
 0.04 for the Powder River Basin, 3.13 for the Western Bituminous region and 1.33 for Central
Appalachia. For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, transportation costs per ton billed to
customers were 0.02 for the Powder River Basin, 2.94 for the Western Bituminous region and 1.60
for Central Appalachia.

Decreases
in sales prices in the Powder River Basin during the first nine months of 2007 when
compared with the first nine months of 2006 primarily reflect the
higher volumes from the Coal Creek mine, which has a lower price due to its lower heat content,
and lower sulfur dioxide emission allowance adjustments, primarily in the first quarter of 2007. In the Western
Bituminous region, higher sales prices during the first nine months of 2007 represent higher base
pricing resulting from the roll-off of lower-priced legacy contracts.

Table of Contents 

In Central Appalachia, the higher realized prices in the first nine months of 2007 reflect the
decrease in the volume of coal sold under lower-priced contracts we retained after the sale of
certain operations to Magnum in 2005.

Expenses, costs and other. Also in 2006, other operating income,
net reflects an 8.6 million charge, representing working capital and other adjustments associated
with the sale of certain Central Appalachia operations in the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase
in operating income resulting from these transactions was offset by a 15.1 million decrease in
realized and unrealized gains on sulfur dioxide emission allowance put options and swaps in the
first nine months of 2007 compared to the first nine months of 2006 due to a decrease in positions
outstanding.

Operating margins. Our operating margins (reflected below on a per-ton basis) include all
mining costs, which consist of all amounts classified as cost of coal sales (except pass-through
transportation costs discussed in Revenues above) and all depreciation, depletion and
amortization attributable to mining operations.

surface and underground mining are related to reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds, eliminating
sedimentation and drainage control structures, and dismantling or demolishing equipment or
buildings

used in mining operations. The establishment of the asset retirement obligation liability is
based upon permit requirements and requires various estimates and assumptions, principally
associated with costs and productivities.

We review our entire environmental liability periodically and make necessary adjustments,
including permit changes and revisions to costs and productivities to reflect current experience.
Our management believes it is making adequate provisions for all expected reclamation and other
associated costs.

Permit Litigation Matters. Surface mines at our Mingo Logan and Coal Mac subsidiaries mining
complexes have been identified as having been granted Clean Water Act 404 permits by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, allegedly in violation of both the Clean Water Act and the National
Environmental Policy Act. The lawsuit, brought by the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, originally had been filed against
the Corps for permits it had issued to coal operations owned by subsidiaries of Massey Energy
Company, which we refer to as Massey, a company unrelated to us or our operating subsidiaries. The
suit against Massey claimed that the Corps had issued permits that did not comply with the National
Environmental Policy Act and violated the Clean Water Act. That suit was tried to completion, and,
on March 23, 2007 the court entered an order rescinding the Massey permits, enjoining activities
authorized by them and remanding them to the Corps on the basis that the Corps did not adequately
address certain issues as to the impacts of the mining activity on the environment. On June 19, 2007, the court also granted plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint
to add the permits issued by the Corps to our operating subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries have
intervened to protect their interests.

While the outcome of this litigation is subject to uncertainties, based on our preliminary
evaluation of the issues and the potential impact on us, we believe these matters will be resolved
without a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

West Virginia Flooding Litigation . Approximately 3,100 plaintiffs have sued us and more than
180 other coal, timber, oil, gas and land companies, including a former subsidiary whom we have
agreed to defend, in fifteen complaints filed in Wyoming, McDowell, Fayette, Kanawha, Raleigh,
Boone and Mercer Counties, West Virginia. The plaintiffs seek recovery for property damage and
personal injuries arising out of a July 8, 2001 flood in southern West Virginia, claiming that
mining, haul road construction and timber removal caused natural surface waters to be diverted to
their properties.

The West Virginia Supreme Court ruled that these cases, along with thirty-four other flood
damage cases not involving us, will be handled under the court s mass litigation rules. As a
result, the cases were transferred to the Circuit Court of Raleigh County, West Virginia, to be
handled by a panel consisting of three circuit court judges. We also are named in the
remaining Upper Guyandotte watershed trial group; however, a trial date has not yet been set for
this group.

While the outcome of this litigation is subject to uncertainties, based on our preliminary
evaluation of the issues and the potential impact on us, we believe this matter will be resolved
without a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

We are a party to numerous other claims and lawsuits and are subject to numerous other
contingencies with respect to various matters. We provide for costs related to contingencies,
including environmental, legal and indemnification matters, when a loss is probable and the amount
is reasonably determinable. After conferring with counsel, it is the opinion of management that the
ultimate resolution of these claims, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.

Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

On January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No.",,"[""Last time ACI traded below $20 per share was in 2005 when Central App pricing was approximately $60 per ton, Western Bit pricing was below $30 per ton and the PRB pricing was at about $6 per ton.\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect the US to export nearly 80 million tons in 2008, that's roughly a 30 million ton increase from the 2006 levels. Our forecast is marginally below previous levels, as we expect the impact from recent hurricanes and the slowing economy to curtail the peak levels, we were forecasting a few months ago.\nMore importantly, however, we still see 2009 exports growing 8% to 10% from 2008 levels. We also expect coal imports from the US to decline as more Columbian coal is diverted into the Atlantic and now the Pacific seaborne trade and we expect imports to be down approximately 2 million tons in 2008 and remain flat in 2009.""]",negative,only_Mgm,treatment,75326,0.0,4.0,-0.99999975,negative,0.595795751,4.0,0.0,4.0,155.0,0.0258064516129032,0.0,0.0258064516129032
"Overview 

We are one of the largest coal producers in the United States.
 For the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold approximately
 135.0 million tons of coal, including approximately
 8.6 million tons of coal we purchased from third parties,
 fueling approximately 6 of all electricity generated in the
 United States. Since federal and state environmental regulations
 limit the amount of sulfur dioxide that power plants may emit,
 we believe demand for low sulfur coal exceeds demand for other
 types of coal. As a result, we focus on mining, processing and
 marketing bituminous and sub-bituminous coal with low sulfur
 content for sale to domestic power plants, steel mills and
 industrial facilities.

In 2007, we estimate that U.S. The increase in selling, general and
 administrative expenses from 2006 to 2007 is primarily due to an
 increase in the expense associated with our deferred
 compensation plans, which results from changes in the value of
 our common stock, as well as other employee compensation costs.

Other operating income, net. The increase in
 other operating income, net in 2007 compared to 2006 is due
 primarily to the following:

an 8.9 million gain on the 2007 sale of the Ben Creek
 complex discussed previously;

a 6.0 million gain on the sale of non-core reserves in the
 Powder River Basin and a 2.4 million gain on the sale of
 non-core reserves in Central Appalachia, both in 2007;

unrealized gains of 5.0 million in 2007 on coal
 derivatives entered into for trading purposes; and

expenses of 8.7 million during 2006 related to the Magnum
 transaction.

These increases in other operating income are partially offset
 by:

a decrease of 15.2 million related to realized and
 unrealized gains in 2006 associated with sulfur dioxide emission
 allowance put options and swaps;

a gain of 10.3 million in 2006 on the acquisition of our
 interest in Knight Hawk Holdings, LLC, representing the
 difference between the fair value of coal reserves we
 surrendered for the interest and their carrying value; and

a decrease of 3.3 million in the amount of income from
 equity investments.

Coal sales prices per ton exclude
 certain transportation costs that we pass through to our
 customers. Since other companies
 may calculate coal sales prices per ton differently, our
 calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
 used by those companies. For the year ended December 31,
 2007, transportation costs per ton billed to customers were
 0.03 for the Powder River Basin, 3.17 for the Western
 Bituminous region and 1.82 for Central Appalachia.
 Transportation costs per ton billed to customers for the year
 ended December 31, 2006 were 0.02 for the Powder River
 Basin, 2.91 for the Western Bituminous region and 1.54 for
 Central Appalachia.

(2)

Operating margin per ton is
 calculated as the result of coal sales revenues less cost of
 coal sales and depreciation, depletion and amortization divided
 by tons sold.

Powder River Basin Sales volume in the Powder
 River Basin increased slightly in 2007 over 2006 levels due to
 increased shipments from the Coal Creek mine, which was
 restarted during 2006, and higher volumes of brokerage activity.
 These volumes were partially offset by a decrease at the Black
 Thunder mining complex due to planned volume reductions in
 response to the weaker market conditions in 2007, as well as
 weather-related shipment challenges and an unplanned belt outage
 that occurred in the first quarter of 2007. Decreases in sales
 prices during 2007 when compared with 2006 primarily reflect the
 higher volumes from the Coal Creek mining complex, which has a
 lower price due to its lower heat content, and lower sulfur
 dioxide emission allowance adjustments. On a per-ton basis,
 operating margins in 2007 decreased from 2006 due in part to the
 decrease in per-ton coal sales prices and an increase in per-ton
 costs. You should see
 Items Affecting Comparability of Reported
 Results beginning on page 38 for more information
 about the gains on the sale of our Powder River Basin assets and
 Central Appalachia operations.

Other operating (income) expense, net. The
 increase in net income in 2006 compared to 2005 from changes in
 other operating (income) expense is due primarily to the
 following:

a decrease of 31.1 million between years in the amount of
 realized and unrealized losses associated with sulfur dioxide
 emission allowance put options and swaps;

a decrease of 13.9 million in the net expense related to
 bookouts between periods (the netting of coal sales and purchase
 contracts with the same counterparty);

a gain of 10.3 million in 2006 on the acquisition of our
 interest in Knight Hawk Holdings, LLC, representing the
 difference between the fair value of coal reserves we
 surrendered for the interest and their carrying value;

an increase of 6.2 million in the amount of income from
 equity investments; and

a 16.0 million expense in 2005 related to settlement of
 certain disputes with a landowner.

These increases in other operating income are partially offset
 by:

a decrease of 28.8 million in gains from sales of
 property, plant and equipment;

expenses of 8.7 million during 2006 related to the Magnum
 transaction; and

a decrease of 4.9 million in the amount of deferred gain
 associated with the sale of our interest in Natural Resource
 Partners, L.P., which we recognize over the terms of our leases
 with Natural Resource Partners L.P., some of which were
 transferred to Magnum.

Coal sales prices per ton exclude
 certain transportation costs that we pass through to our
 customers.","Our profitability and the value of our coal reserves depend upon
 the prices we receive for our coal. In turn, the prices we
 receive for our coal depend upon factors beyond our control,
 including the following:

the supply of and demand for domestic and foreign coal;

the demand for electricity and steel;

domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes,
 including those establishing air emission standards for
 coal-fueled power plants;

regulatory, administrative and judicial decisions, including
 those affecting future mining permits;

the proximity, capacity and cost of transportation facilities;

the availability and price of alternative fuels, such as natural
 gas, and alternative energy sources, such as hydroelectric, wind
 and solar power;

technological developments, including those intended to convert
 coal to liquid or gas and those aimed at capturing and
 sequestering carbon; and

the effects of worldwide energy conservation measures.

Declines in the prices we receive for our coal could adversely
 affect our profitability and the value of our coal reserves.

Certain
 conditions and events beyond our control could negatively impact
 our coal mining operations, our production or our operating
 costs. 

We mine coal at underground and surface mining operations.
 Certain factors beyond our control, including those listed
 below, could disrupt our coal mining operations, reduce our
 production or increase our operating costs:

delays and difficulties in acquiring, maintaining or renewing
 necessary permits or mining or surface rights;

23

Table of Contents 

changes or variations in geological conditions, such as the
 thickness of the coal deposits and the amount of rock embedded
 in or overlying the coal deposit;

mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected
 maintenance problems;

interruptions due to transportation delays;

adverse weather and natural disasters, such as heavy rains or
 snow and flooding;

shortage of qualified labor;

unexpected or accidental surface subsidence from underground
 mining;

accidental mine water discharges, fires, explosions or similar
 mining accidents; and

regulatory issues involving the plugging of and mining through
 oil and gas wells that penetrate the coal seams we mine.

If any of these conditions or events occurs, particularly at our
 Black Thunder mining complex, our coal mining operations may be
 disrupted, we could experience a delay or halt of production or
 our operating costs could increase significantly. In addition,
 if our insurance coverage is limited or excludes certain of
 these conditions or events, then we may not be able to recover
 any of the losses we may incur as a result of such conditions or
 events, some of which may be substantial.

Increases
 in the costs of mining and other industrial supplies, including
 steel-based supplies, diesel fuel and rubber tires, or the
 inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of those supplies,
 could negatively affect our operating costs or disrupt or delay
 our production. 

We depend upon barge, ship, rail, truck and belt transportation
 systems to deliver coal to our customers. Disruptions in
 transportation services due to weather-related problems,
 mechanical difficulties, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks, and
 other events could impair our ability to supply coal to our
 customers. As we do not have long-term contracts with
 transportation providers to ensure consistent and reliable
 service, decreased performance levels over longer periods of
 time could cause our customers to look to other sources for
 their coal needs. 

We continually seek to expand our operations and coal reserves
 through acquisitions of other businesses and assets, including
 leasehold interests. Certain risks, including those listed
 below, could cause us not to realize the benefits we expect to
 occur as a result of those acquisitions:

uncertainties in assessing the value, risks, profitability and
 liabilities (including environmental liabilities) associated
 with certain businesses or assets;

the potential loss of key customers, management and employees of
 an acquired business;

the possibility that operating and financial synergies expected
 to result from an acquisition do not develop;

problems arising from the integration of an acquired
 business; and

unanticipated changes in business, industry or general economic
 conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the rationale
 for a particular acquisition.

Our
 profitability depends upon the long-term coal supply agreements
 we have with our customers. Changes in purchasing patterns in
 the coal industry could make it difficult for us to extend our
 existing long-term coal supply agreements or to enter into new
 agreements in the future. If any of those customers,
 particularly any of our three largest customers, was to
 significantly reduce the quantities of coal it purchases from
 us, or if we are unable to sell coal to those customers on terms
 as favorable to us as the terms under our current long-term coal
 supply agreements, our profitability could suffer significantly.
 We have limited protection during adverse economic conditions
 and may face economic penalties if we are unable to satisfy
 certain quality specifications under our long-term coal supply
 agreements.

26

Table of Contents 

Our long-term coal supply agreements typically contain force
 majeure provisions allowing the parties to temporarily
 suspend performance during specified events beyond their
 control. Most of our long-term coal supply agreements also
 contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal that satisfies
 certain quality specifications, such as heat value, sulfur
 content, ash content, hardness and ash fusion temperature. These
 provisions in our long-term coal supply agreements could result
 in negative economic consequences to us, including price
 adjustments, purchasing replacement coal in a higher-priced open
 market, the rejection of deliveries or, in the extreme, contract
 termination. 

Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity
 or acts of war have significant effects on general economic
 conditions, fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending and
 market liquidity. Future terrorist attacks, rumors or threats of
 war, actual conflicts involving the United States or its allies,
 or military or trade disruptions affecting our customers may
 significantly affect our operations and those of our customers.
 As a result, we could experience delays or losses in
 transportation and deliveries of coal to our customers,
 decreased sales of our coal or extended collections from our
 customers.

Risks
 Related to Environmental and Other Regulations 

Governmental
 regulations impose significant costs on us and our customers,
 and future regulations could increase those costs or limit our
 ability to produce and sell coal. 

Governmental regulations, including those related to the matters
 listed below, have significant effects on the coal mining
 industry:

employee health and safety;

mine permitting and licensing requirements;

reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is
 completed;

air quality standards;

water pollution;

the discharge of materials into the environment;

management of materials generated by mining operations;

surface subsidence from underground mining;

statutorily mandated benefits for current and retired coal
 miners;

protection of wetlands;

endangered plant and wildlife protection;

limitations on land use;

storage and disposal of petroleum products and substances that
 are regarded as hazardous under applicable laws; and

management of electrical equipment containing PCBs.

28

Table of Contents 

The costs, liabilities and requirements associated with these
 regulations may be significant and time-consuming and may delay
 commencement or continuation of exploration or production
 operations. New legislation or
 administrative regulations (or new judicial interpretations or
 administrative enforcement of existing laws and regulations),
 including proposals related to the protection of the environment
 that would further regulate and tax our business or our
 customers, may also require us or our customers to change
 operations significantly or incur increased costs. These
 regulations, if enacted in the future, could have a material
 adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
 of operations.

You should see Safety and Environmental Regulations 
 beginning on page 14 for more information about the various
 governmental regulations affecting us.

Our
 failure to obtain and renew permits necessary for our mining
 operations could negatively affect our business. 

Mining companies must obtain numerous permits that regulate
 environmental and health and safety matters in connection with
 coal mining, including permits issued by various federal and
 state agencies and regulatory bodies. We believe that we have
 obtained the necessary permits to mine our developed reserves at
 our mining complexes. The permits
 may also involve requirements that may be changed or interpreted
 in a manner which restricts our ability to conduct our mining
 operations or to do so profitably. An inability to conduct our
 mining operations pursuant to applicable permits would reduce
 our production, cash flow and profitability.

The
 characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to
 comply with various environmental standards related to coal
 combustion or utilization. As a result, coal users may switch to
 other fuels, which could affect the volume of our sales and the
 price of our products. 

Coal contains impurities, including but not limited to sulfur,
 mercury, chlorine, carbon and other elements or compounds, many
 of which are released into the air when coal is burned. Stricter
 environmental regulations of emissions from coal-fueled power
 plants could increase the costs of using coal thereby reducing
 demand for coal as a fuel source and the volume and price of our
 coal sales. Stricter regulations could make coal a less
 attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of
 power plants in the future.

Proposed reductions in emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxides,
 nitrogen oxides, particulate matter or greenhouse gases may
 require the installation of costly emission control technology
 or the implementation of other measures, including trading of
 emission allowances and switching to other fuels. For example,
 in order to meet the federal Clean Air Act limits for sulfur
 dioxide emissions from power plants, coal users may need to
 install scrubbers, use sulfur dioxide emission allowances (some
 of which they may purchase), blend high sulfur coal with
 low-sulfur coal or switch to other fuels. Reductions in mercury
 emissions required by certain states will likely require some
 power plants to install new equipment, at substantial cost, or
 discourage the use of certain coals containing higher levels of
 mercury. Recent and new proposals calling for reductions in
 emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could
 significantly increase the cost of operating existing
 coal-fueled power

29

Table of Contents 

plants and could inhibit construction of new coal-fueled power
 plants. Existing or proposed legislation focusing on emissions
 enacted by the United States or individual states could make
 coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and
 could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal. If our
 customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or
 switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future
 environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our
 operations and financial results could be adversely impacted.

If the
 assumptions underlying our estimates of reclamation and mine
 closure obligations are inaccurate, our costs could be greater
 than anticipated. 

SMCRA establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards
 for all aspects of surface mining, as well as most aspects of
 underground mining. The third-party
 profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be
 charged by contractors for work performed on our behalf. If
 actual costs differ from our estimates, our profitability could
 be negatively affected.

Our
 operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to
 hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental
 contamination, which could result in material liabilities to
 us. 

Our operations currently use hazardous materials and generate
 limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time to time. Some of
 our impoundments overlie mined out areas, which can pose a
 heightened risk of failure and of damages arising out of
 failure. If one of our impoundments were to fail, we could be
 subject to substantial claims for the resulting environmental
 contamination and associated liability, as well as for fines and
 penalties.

Drainage flowing from or caused by mining activities can be
 acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals, a condition
 referred to as acid mine drainage, which we refer to
 as AMD. The treating of AMD can be costly.","[""Last time ACI traded below $20 per share was in 2005 when Central App pricing was approximately $60 per ton, Western Bit pricing was below $30 per ton and the PRB pricing was at about $6 per ton.\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect the US to export nearly 80 million tons in 2008, that's roughly a 30 million ton increase from the 2006 levels.

"Our core activities consist of the maintenance, upgrade
and extension of electric distribution and sub-500 kV transmission power lines. Our customers
include more than 150 electric utilities, cooperatives and municipalities across a contiguous
19-state region that stretches from Pennsylvania in the north to Florida in the southeast and to
Texas in the southwest.

We monitor our revenues by the two categories of services we provide: powerline and storm
restoration. We use this breakdown because powerline services represent our ongoing service
revenues, most of which are generated by our customers recurring maintenance needs, while storm
restoration revenues are dependent on weather-related events.

Our powerline services are our core business because these services generate more stable and
predictable revenues than does our storm restoration work. Powerline services have benefited from
favorable industry growth trends, growth in electricity demand, increased outsourcing and the
inadequacy of the current electric infrastructure. Although storm restoration services can generate
significant revenues, the frequency and severity of storms are unpredictable. During the nine
months ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, we experienced significant storm restoration activity
resulting in storm revenues of 175.3 million and 147.0 million, respectively. We cannot
accurately predict the occurrence or magnitude of future storm restoration revenues.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2006 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2005 

Revenues. Revenues increased 2.7 million, or 1.8 , to 157.2 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2006 from 154.5 million for the same quarter a year ago. The increase was due to
an 8.3 million increase in powerline revenues that was partly offset by a 5.6 million decrease in
storm revenues compared to the same period in the prior year.

Our powerline service revenues increased 6.0 to 148.0 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2006 from 139.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005. Both powerline
man-hours and revenue per hour increased slightly compared to the prior year.

Our storm restoration revenues decreased 37.9 to 9.2 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2006 from 14.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005. This decrease in storm
restoration revenue was primarily the result of ice storms in January 2005.

Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased 0.6 million to 17.3 million for the three month period
ended March 31, 2006 from 17.9 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2005. Our gross
margin declined to 11.0 in the three month period ended March 31, 2006 from 11.6 in the three
month period ended March 31, 2005 primarily due to decreased higher margin storm restoration
revenues as well as increased costs for labor, fuel and insurance.

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 1.6
million to 9.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006 from 8.2 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2005 primarily related to operating as a public company and an increase in
stock compensation expense of approximately 0.9 million related to the adoption of FAS 123R as of
July 1, 2005. Revenues increased 47.2 million, or 9.0 , to 571.4 million for the nine months
ended March 31, 2006 from 524.2 million for the same period a year ago. The increase was due to a
 28.3 million increase in storm revenues coupled with an 18.9 million increase in powerline
revenues compared to the same period in the prior year. We generated substantial revenues from
storm restoration services in the nine months ended March 31, 2006 related to major storms
impacting the Gulf Coast and Florida.

Our powerline service revenues increased 4.8 to 396.1 million for the nine months ended
March 31, 2006 from 377.2 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2005. Total powerline
man-hours increased primarily due to an increased workload from our existing customers. Revenue
per man-hour increased slightly for the nine months ended March 31, 2006 compared to the prior
year.

Our storm restoration revenues increased 19.3 to 175.3 million for the nine months ended
March 31, 2006 from 147.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2005. This increase in storm
restoration revenue was primarily the result of major storms in the current fiscal year, including
Tropical Storm Cindy and Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, Rita and Wilma and ice storms affecting
Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. This past hurricane season had the largest
number of named storms in history. Storm revenues are unpredictable.

Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 9.2 million to 105.4 million for the nine month
period ended March 31, 2006 from 96.2 million for the nine month period ended March 31, 2005. Our
gross margin was relatively flat at 18.4 for the nine month period ended March 30, 2006 compared
to 18.3 for the same period in 2005 primarily due to an increase in higher margin storm
restoration revenues partially offset by increased costs for labor, fuel and insurance.

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased 1.5
million to 32.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2006 from 33.5 million for the nine
months ended March 31, 2005 primarily as the result of eliminating certain non-recurring charges
such as 4.2 million in stock option expense relating to our March 2005 recapitalization from the
prior year, partially offset by increased administrative costs as a result of operating as a public
company and an increase in stock compensation expense of approximately 2.5 million related to the
adoption of FAS 123R as of July 1, 2005. As
of March 31, 2006, our cash totaled 3.0 million and we had 62.4 million available under the 90.0
million revolving portion of our senior credit facility (after giving effect to outstanding standby
letters of credit of approximately 27.6 million).

We believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings available under our senior credit
facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs through the fiscal year ended June 30,
2007. However, our ability to pay the interest on or refinance our indebtedness or to fund planned
capital expenditures will depend on our future performance, which, to a certain extent, is subject
to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, weather and other factors
that are beyond our control.

We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, primarily due to the
impact of weather conditions on our customers electric infrastructure and the corresponding
spending by our customers on electric service and repairs. We may experience seasonal working
capital needs from approximately August through February of each year in connection with our storm
restoration services. The increased service activity causes an excess of customer billings over
customer collections, leading to increased accounts receivable during those periods. As of March 31, 2006, we have approximately 40.5
million in surety bonds outstanding. In addition, we have provided collateral in the form of a
letter of credit to sureties in the amount of 7.5 million, which is included in the total letters
of credit outstanding above.

Seasonality 

Our services are performed outdoors, causing our results of operations to be subject to
seasonal variations due to weather conditions. These seasonal variations affect both our powerline
and storm restoration services. In the nine months ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, we experienced
significant storm restoration activity as a result of hurricanes affecting the Gulf States and
Florida and ice storms that impacted Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. The
storm revenues for 2006 and 2005 were substantially higher than historical levels. During the
winter months, demand for powerline work is generally lower due to inclement weather. In addition,
demand for powerline work generally increases during the spring months due to improved weather
conditions and is typically the highest during the summer due to better weather conditions.
Periods of extended rainfall will have a negative impact on powerline revenues. In addition, our
results of operations are subject to significant variations related to storm restoration services.
Due to the unpredictable nature of storms, the level of our storm restoration revenues fluctuates
from period to period.

Services 

We monitor our revenues by the two categories of services we provide: powerline and storm
restoration. We use this breakdown because powerline services represent our ongoing service
revenues, most of which are generated by our customers recurring maintenance needs. Storm
restoration revenues represent additional revenue opportunities that depend on weather conditions.

Our powerline services are our core business because of the magnitude and stability of our
revenues from these operations. These powerline services have benefited from the industry trends
described above. Although storm restoration services can generate significant revenues, their
unpredictability is demonstrated by comparing our revenues from those services in the last five
fiscal years which have ranged from 2.6 to 25.5 of our total revenues. During fiscal 2006 and
2005, we experienced the largest storm restoration events of our history as several significant
hurricanes affected the Gulf Coast and Florida. Our storm restoration revenue for fiscal 2006 and
2005 are not indicative of the revenues that we typically generate in any period or can be expected
to generate in any future period. We cannot accurately predict the occurrence or magnitude of
future storm restoration revenues.

Seasonality; Fluctuations of Results 

Our services are performed outdoors, causing our results of operations to be subject to
seasonal variations due to weather conditions. These seasonal variations affect both our powerline
and storm restoration services. Extended periods of rain affect the deployment of our powerline
crews, particularly with respect to underground work. During the winter months, demand for
powerline work is generally lower due to inclement weather. In addition, demand for powerline work
generally increases during the spring months due to improved weather conditions and is typically
the highest during the summer due to better weather conditions. Demand for electrical repairs is
generally higher during the fall months due to damage caused by weather conditions, such as
hurricanes. In addition, our results of operations are subject to significant variations related to
storm restoration services. Due to the unpredictable nature of storms, the level of our storm
restoration revenues fluctuates from period to period. See Risk Factors. However, we have experienced
significant increases in the costs of fuel used to operate our vehicles and equipment during fiscal
2006.

Basis of Reporting 

Revenues. We derive our revenues from one reportable segment through two service categories 
powerline and storm restoration. Our core powerline services consist of the maintenance, upgrade
and extension of electric distribution and transmission power lines and various ancillary services.
Our storm restoration services involve the rapid deployment of our highly-trained crews and related
equipment to restore power on distribution and transmission systems during crisis situations, such
as hurricanes or ice or wind storms.

Over 90 of our services, including substantially all of our powerline and a majority of our
storm restoration services, are provided under master service arrangements, or MSAs, which are
based on a price per hour worked or a price per unit of service. Less than 5 of our annual
revenues are from fixed-price agreements. In addition, we do not derive significant revenues from
large-scale capital projects, which typically involve competitive bidding, fixed price agreements
and substantial performance bond requirements. The mix of hourly and per unit revenues changes
during periods of high storm restoration services, as these services are all billed on an hourly
basis. We determine our revenue generated on an hourly basis based on actual labor and equipment
time completed and on materials billed to our customers. The determination of the allowance includes
certain judgments and estimates including our customers willingness or ability to pay and our
ongoing relationship with the customer. In certain instances, primarily relating to storm
restoration work and other high volume billing situations, billed amounts may differ from
ultimately collected amounts. We incorporate our historical experience with our customers into the
estimation of the allowance for doubtful accounts. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , we test our goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Examples of such events or circumstances could include
a significant change in business climate or a loss of significant customers. We generally complete
our annual analysis of our reporting unit on the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter. Volatility is based on the average long-term implied
volatilities of peer companies as we have limited trading history. The expected life is based on an
approximate average of the ten-year term of the options and the five-year weighted-average graded
vesting period, and forfeitures are estimated at 5 based on certain historical data as we have
limited trading history beginning July 27, 2005 to present.

Year Ended June 30, 2006 Compared to Year Ended June 30, 2005 

Revenues. Revenues increased 48.3 million to 727.5 million for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2006 from 679.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. The increase was due to a
 36.0 million increase in storm revenues coupled with a 12.3 million increase in powerline
revenues compared to the prior year. We generated substantial revenues from storm restoration
services during fiscal 2006 related to major storms impacting the Gulf Coast and Florida.

Our powerline services revenue increased 2.3 , to 542.2 million in fiscal 2006 from 529.9
million in fiscal 2005. Total powerline man-hours increased primarily due to an increased workload
from our existing customers. Revenue per man-hour increased slightly for fiscal 2006 compared to
the prior year. Total headcount increased by 500 to approximately 6,900 at June 30, 2006 compared
to approximately 6,400 at June 30, 2005.

Our storm restoration revenues increased 24.1 to 185.3 million for fiscal 2006 from 149.3
million for fiscal 2005. This increase in storm restoration revenue was primarily the result of
major storms in fiscal 2006, including Tropical Storm Cindy and Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, Rita
and Wilma and ice storms affecting Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. The 2005
hurricane season had the largest number of named storms in history. Our storm revenues are highly
volatile and unpredictable. Our storm restoration revenues for fiscal 2006 and 2005 were the
highest in the history of our Company and are not indicative of the
revenues that we have typically
generated in the past or can be expected to be generated in the future.

Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 34.4 million to 128.2 million for fiscal 2006 from
 93.8 million for fiscal 2005, primarily due to a 21.1 million charge recorded in fiscal 2005
attributable to the cost of operations portion of the deferred compensation charge related to our
acquisition of Red Simpson. Excluding a charge related to the Red Simpson acquisition in fiscal
2005, gross margins would have increased to 17.6 from 16.9 . The remaining

30 

Table of Contents 

increase is primarily due to an increase in higher margin storm restoration revenues in fiscal
2006 partially offset by increased costs for labor, fuel and insurance.

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased 2.7
million to 45.2 million for fiscal 2006 from 47.9 million for fiscal 2005. Revenues increased 322.5 million to 679.2 million for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2005 from 356.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. This increase was primarily
attributable to the acquisition of Red Simpson in July 2004, the
substantial annual storm revenues and, to a lesser extent, organic growth. Red Simpson contributed 223.8 million of
incremental revenue while Pike accounted for the remaining 98.7 million of the increase.

Our powerline services revenue increased 216.2 million, or 68.9 , to 529.9 million in fiscal
2005 from 313.7 million in fiscal 2004. The Red Simpson acquisition accounted for approximately
 185.1 million of this increase while Pike accounted for the remaining 31.1 million of growth.
Excluding the Red Simpson acquisition, total powerline man-hours increased, due primarily to an
increased workload from our existing customers, while revenue per man-hour increased slightly.

Additionally, storm restoration revenues increased 106.3 million to 149.3 million for fiscal
2005 from 43.0 million for fiscal 2004. This increase in storm restoration revenue included 38.7
million in storm restoration revenue from Red Simpson and 67.6 million of additional storm
restoration revenue from Pike, excluding Red Simpson. The increase was primarily the result of the
significant storm restoration events that occurred when four hurricanes affected Florida and the
surrounding Gulf states during August and September of 2004.

31 

Table of Contents 

Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 37.4 million to 93.8 million for fiscal 2005 from
 56.4 million for fiscal 2004, primarily due to the increase in revenues described above and
partially offset by a 21.1 million charge related to the cost of operations portion of the
deferred compensation charge related to our acquisition of Red Simpson. Excluding this charge, gross margins would have
increased to 16.9 . The increase is primarily the result of higher-margin storm restoration
revenues of 22.0 of total revenues in fiscal 2005 from 12.1 of total revenues in fiscal 2004.

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 29.1
million to 47.9 million for fiscal 2005 from 18.8 million for fiscal 2004. The primary sources of cash for fiscal 2005 were
cash borrowed under our refinanced senior credit facility and, to a lesser extent, cash provided by
the issuance of stock and cash provided by operations. The primary sources of cash for fiscal 2004
were cash provided by operations and, to a lesser extent, cash provided by borrowings under our
senior credit facility.

We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, primarily due to the
impact of weather conditions on the electric infrastructure and the corresponding spending by our
customers on electric service and

32 

Table of Contents 

repairs. We may experience seasonal working capital needs from approximately August through
February in connection with our storm restoration services. The increased service activity causes
an excess of customer billings over customer collections, leading to increased accounts receivable
during those periods. The Company s
customers include more than 150 electric utilities, cooperatives and municipalities across a
contiguous 19-state region that stretches from Pennsylvania in the north to Florida in the
southeast and to Texas in the southwest. The Company s core services consist of the maintenance,
upgrade and extension of electric distribution and sub-500 Kilovolt kV transmission power lines.
Additionally, the Company provides storm restoration services and a variety of ancillary services.
The Company does not have any operations or assets outside the United States.

The Company monitors revenues by two categories of services: powerline and storm restoration.
The Company uses this breakdown because powerline services represent its ongoing service revenues,
most of which are generated by its customers recurring maintenance needs. Storm restoration
revenues represent additional revenue opportunities that depend on weather conditions.

2. Significant Accounting Policies 

Accounting Principles 

The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles.

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. The determination of the allowance includes certain judgments
and estimates including the customers willingness or ability to pay and the ongoing relationship
with the customer. In certain instances, primarily relating to storm restoration work and other
high volume billing situations, billed amounts may differ from ultimately collected amounts. The
Company incorporates its historical experience with its customers into the estimation of the
allowance for doubtful accounts. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company tests
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more
frequently if events or circumstances exist which indicate impairment may exist. Examples of such
events or circumstances may include a significant change in

business climate, a loss of significant customers or the other parties to non-compete
agreements breaching their obligations thereunder, among others. The Company generally completes
its annual analysis of the reporting unit on the first day of its fourth fiscal quarter. The fair value was determined to be 8.35 per
share based upon applying a market approach. The increase in value was primarily due to the
increase in operating results from the significant storm revenue for the six months ended December
31, 2004 and significant debt prepayments using the cash generated by that storm work. In addition,
the positive operating results from the recent acquisition of Red Simpson contributed to the
increase in value.","We had an existing relationship with some of Red Simpson s customers, but a number of the
relationships were new. Because of our relatively brief relationship with these customers, we
could be more exposed than normal to losing a portion or all of their business to our competitors.

Our storm restoration services are highly volatile and unpredictable, which could result in
substantial variations in, and uncertainties regarding, the levels of our financial results from
period to period. As shown by the following table, revenues derived from our storm restoration
services are highly volatile and uncertain due to the unpredictable nature of weather-related
events.

"Our core activities consist of the maintenance,
upgrade and extension of electric distribution and sub-500 kV transmission power lines. Our
customers include more than 150 electric utilities, cooperatives and municipalities across a
contiguous 19-state region that stretches from Pennsylvania in the north to Florida in the
southeast and to Texas in the southwest.

We monitor our revenues by the two categories of services we provide: powerline and storm
restoration. We use this breakdown because powerline services represent our ongoing service
revenues, most of which are generated by our customers recurring maintenance needs, and storm
restoration revenues represent additional revenue opportunities that depend on weather conditions.

Our powerline services are our core business because of the magnitude and stability of our
revenues from these operations. These powerline services have benefited from favorable industry
growth trends including a growth in demand for electricity, the passage of the Energy Policy Act of
2005, increased outsourcing of infrastructure services by electric companies and the inadequacy of
the current electric infrastructure. Although storm restoration services can generate significant
revenues, the frequency and severity of storms are highly unpredictable. For the three months
ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, storm restoration activity resulted in revenues of 12.3 million
and 94.9 million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2005 we experienced
the largest storm restoration events of our history as several significant hurricanes affected the
Gulf Coast and Florida. Our storm restoration revenue for the three months ended September 30,
2005 is not indicative of the revenues that we typically generate in any period or should be
expected to generate in any future period. As an illustration of the volatility of our storm
restoration services, our annual storm restoration revenues have ranged from a low of 7.0 million
to a high of 185.3 million during the seven fiscal years ended June 30, 2006. We cannot
accurately predict the occurrence or magnitude of future storm restoration revenues.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on
our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Once the crews and equipment are fully utilized, our
margins generally increase over the life of the contract. 

The significant storm activity during our fiscal years 2006 and 2005 has had a
significant financial impact on several of our customers. As a result, they may defer
certain powerline maintenance projects, which would affect our powerline revenues. In addition, we have entered into two diesel fuel swaps that cover,
based on current volumes, approximately 15 of our diesel requirements in October 2006 and
30 of our diesel requirements for the period from November 2006 through February 2008.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2006 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2005 

Revenues. Revenues decreased 68.5 million to 149.9 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2006 from 218.4 million for three months ended September 30, 2005. The decrease was
due to an 82.5 million decrease in storm restoration revenues, partially offset by a 14.0 million
increase in powerline revenues compared to the prior year. We generated unusually significant
revenues from storm restoration services during the first fiscal quarter of the prior year related
to major hurricanes that impacted the Gulf Coast and Florida.

Our powerline revenues increased 11.3 , to 137.6 million for the quarter ended September 30,
2006 from 123.5 million for the same quarter a year ago. Powerline billable man-hours increased
approximately 10 and revenue per man-hour increased slightly. The growth in powerline revenues is
primarily a result of continued maintenance projects with existing customers.

Our storm restoration revenues decreased 87.1 to 12.3 million for for the three months ended
September 30, 2006 from 94.9 million for fiscal 2005. There were no significant storm events in
the first quarter of this year in contrast to the several major storms in the first quarter of the
prior year, including Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina and Rita. Our storm restoration revenues are
highly volatile and unpredictable.

Total billable hours decreased by approximately 26 during the quarter ended September 30,
2006. Our crews work significant amounts of overtime during storm restoration projects. In
addition, our revenue-producing headcount decreased approximately 4 from September 30, 2005 to
September 30, 2006.

Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased 29.0 million to 19.7 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2006 from 48.7 million for the same quarter a year ago. Gross profit as a
percentage of revenues decreased to 13.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2006 from 22.3 
the three months ended September 30, 2005, primarily due to the significant decrease in higher
margin storm restoration revenues, losses in our Florida operation, an increase in fuel costs and
an increase in indirect labor as a percentage of revenues.

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 0.5
million to 11.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006 from 11.1 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2005. These expenses were
partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expenses primarily due to the
acceleration of certain awards at completion of our initial public offering in August 2005 and a
reversal of deferred compensation expenses related to certain employee forfeitures. As a
percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 7.7 from 5.1 primarily
due to lower revenues that resulted from a significant decrease in storm restoration revenues.

Loss on Sale of Property and Equipment . Loss on sale of property and equipment increased 0.3
million to 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006 compared to 0.1 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2005. Our primary source of cash for the three months ended September 30,
2006 was cash provided by operations. Our primary source of cash for the three months ended
September 30, 2005 was cash provided by the issuance of stock.

We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, primarily due to the
impact of weather conditions on the electric infrastructure and the corresponding spending by our
customers on electric service and repairs. We may experience seasonal working capital needs from
approximately August through February in connection with our storm restoration services. The
increased service activity causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections, leading
to increased accounts receivable during those periods. As of September 30, 2006, we have
approximately 32.4 million in surety bonds outstanding. In addition, we have provided collateral
in the form of a letter of credit to sureties in the amount of 7.5 million, which is included in
the total letters of credit outstanding above.

Seasonality; Fluctuations of Results 

Our services are performed outdoors, causing our results of operations to be subject to
seasonal variations due to weather conditions. These seasonal variations affect both our powerline
and storm restoration services. Extended periods of rain affect the deployment of our powerline
crews, particularly with respect to underground work. During the winter months, demand for
powerline work is generally lower due to inclement weather. In addition, demand for powerline work
generally increases during the spring months due to improved weather conditions and is typically
the highest during the summer due to better weather conditions. Demand for electrical repairs may
be impacted during the fall months due to damage caused by weather conditions, such as hurricanes.
In addition, our results of operations are subject to significant variations related to storm
restoration services. As an illustration of the volatility of our storm restoration services, our
annual storm restoration revenues have ranged from a low of 7.0 million to a high of 185.3
million during the seven fiscal years ended September 20, 2006. Due to the unpredictable nature of
storms, the level of our storm restoration revenues fluctuates from period to period.

Inflation 

Due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the first three months of fiscal
2006 and 2005, inflation did not have a significant effect on our results. However, we have
experienced significant increases in the costs of fuel used to operate our vehicles and equipment
during fiscal 2006 and the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In June 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. This risk may be accentuated for customers we
obtained in the Red Simpson acquisition. 

Our storm restoration services are highly volatile and unpredictable, which could result
in substantial variations in, and uncertainties regarding, the levels of our financial
results from period to period.

"Our core activities consist of the maintenance,
upgrade and extension of electric distribution and sub-500 kV transmission power lines. Our
customers include more than 150 electric utilities, cooperatives and municipalities across a
contiguous 19-state region that stretches from Pennsylvania in the north to Florida in the
southeast and to Texas in the southwest.

We monitor our revenues by the two categories of services we provide: powerline and storm
restoration. We use this breakdown because powerline services represent our ongoing service
revenues, most of which are generated by our customers recurring maintenance needs, and storm
restoration revenues represent additional revenue opportunities that depend on weather conditions.

Our powerline services are our core business because of the magnitude and stability of our
revenues from these operations. These powerline services have benefited from favorable industry
growth trends including a growth in demand for electricity, the passage of the Energy Policy Act of
2005, increased outsourcing of infrastructure services by electric companies and the inadequacy of
the current electric infrastructure. Although storm restoration services can generate significant
revenues, the frequency and severity of storms are highly unpredictable. For the three months
ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, storm restoration activity resulted in revenues of 14.1 million
and 71.2 million, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, storm
restoration activity resulted in revenues of 26.3 million and 166.2 million, respectively.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 we experienced the largest storm
restoration events of our history as several significant hurricanes affected the Gulf Coast and
Florida. Our storm restoration revenue for the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 is not
indicative of the revenues that we typically generate in any period or should be expected to
generate in any future period. As an illustration of the volatility of our storm restoration
services, our annual storm restoration revenues have ranged from a low of 7.0 million to a high of
 185.3 million during the seven fiscal years ended June 30, 2006. We cannot accurately predict the
occurrence or magnitude of future storm restoration revenues.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on
our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Once the crews and equipment are fully utilized, our
margins generally increase over the life of the arrangement. 

The significant storm activity during our two most recently completed fiscal years has
had a significant financial impact on several of our customers. As a result, they may
defer certain powerline maintenance projects, which would affect our powerline revenues. In addition, we have entered into two diesel
fuel swaps that cover, based on current volumes, approximately 30 of our diesel
requirements for the period from January 2007 through February 2008.

Three Months Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2005 

Revenues. Revenues decreased 24.2 , or 47.3 million, to 148.4 million for the three months
ended December 31, 2006 from 195.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005. The
decrease was due to a 57.1 million decrease in storm restoration revenues partially offset by a
 9.8 million increase in powerline revenues compared to the prior fiscal year. We generated
unusually significant revenues from storm restoration services during the three months ended
December 31, 2005 related to major hurricanes that impacted the Gulf Coast and Florida.

Our powerline revenues increased 7.9 to 134.3 million for the three months ended December
31, 2006 from 124.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Powerline billable man-hours
increased 6.4 and revenue per man-hour increased 1.4 . The growth in powerline revenues is
primarily a result of continued maintenance projects with existing customers.

Our storm restoration revenues decreased 80.3 to 14.1 million for the three months ended
December 31, 2006 from 71.2 million for the same period in the prior year. There was significant
storm restoration work in the three months ended December 31, 2005 because of the damage caused by
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Our storm restoration revenues are highly volatile and
unpredictable.

Total billable hours decreased by 20.3 during the three months ended December 31, 2006
compared to the same period in the prior year. Our crews worked significant amounts of overtime
during storm restoration projects during the three months ended December 31, 2005. In addition,
our average revenue-producing headcount decreased 5.8 during the three months ending December 31,
2006 compared to the same period in the prior year.

Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased 37.8 , or 14.9 million, to 24.5 million for the three
months ended December 31, 2006 from 39.4 million for the same period in the prior year. Gross
profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 16.5 for the three months ended

10 

December 31, 2006
from 20.1 the three months ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to the significant decrease in
higher margin storm restoration revenues, losses in our Florida operation and an increase in
depreciation expense related to a change in estimated salvage values on fleet equipment. The
impact of these items was partially offset by a reduction in our workers compensation expense.

General and Administrative Expenses. This decrease is primarily due to lower compensation related
expenses, partially offset by increased legal fees associated with non-compete litigation against
former employees. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to
7.2 from 5.7 primarily due to lower revenues that resulted from a significant decrease in storm
restoration revenues.

Loss on Sale of Property and Equipment . Loss on sale of property and equipment decreased 0.1
million to 0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2006 compared to 0.2 million for
the three months ended December 31, 2005. Revenues decreased 28.0 , or 116.0 million, to 298.2 million for the six months
ended December 31, 2006 from 414.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease
was due to a 139.9 million decrease in storm revenues partially offset by a 23.9 million increase
in powerline revenues. We generated substantial revenues from storm restoration services in the
six months ended December 31, 2005 related to major storms impacting the Gulf Coast and Florida.

Our powerline service revenues increased 9.6 to 271.9 million in the six months ended
December 31, 2006 from 248.0 million in the six months ended December 31, 2005. Powerline
billable man-hours increased 8.0 and revenue per man-hour increased 1.5 . The growth in powerline
revenues is primarily a result of continued maintenance projects with existing customers.

Our storm restoration revenues decreased 84.1 to 26.3 million for the six months ended
December 31, 2006 from 166.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2005. We generated
unusually significant revenues from storm restoration services during the first six months of the
prior year due primarily to Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma that impacted the Gulf
Coast and Florida.

Total billable hours decreased 23.2 during the six months ended December 31, 2006 compared to
the same period in the prior fiscal year. Our crews worked significant amounts of overtime during
storm restoration projects during the six months ended December 31, 2005. In addition, our average
revenue-producing headcount decreased 4.9 during the six months ending December 31, 2006 from the
same period in the prior year.

Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased 43.8 million to 44.3 million for the six months ended
December 31, 2006 from 88.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2005. Gross profit as a
percentage of revenues decreased to 14.8 from 21.3 during the six months ended December 31, 2005
primarily due to the significant decrease in higher margin storm restoration revenues, losses in
our Florida operation and an increase in depreciation expense related to a change in estimated
salvage values on fleet equipment. The impact of these items was partially offset by a reduction
in our workers compensation expense.

General and Administrative Expenses. This increase is primarily due to higher legal fees associated
with non-compete litigation against former employees, expenses related to the termination of our
former chief financial officer, and an increase in expenses related to implementation costs
relating to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, partially offset by lower compensation related expenses. As
a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 7.5 from 5.3 primarily
due to lower revenues that resulted from a significant decrease in storm restoration revenues.

Loss on Sale of Property and Equipment . Loss on sale of property and equipment increased 0.2
million to 0.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2006 compared to 0.3 million for the
six months ended December 31, 2005. Our primary source of cash for the six months ended December 31, 2006
was cash provided by operations. Our primary sources of cash for the six months ended December 31,
2005 were cash provided by the issuance of stock and, to a lesser extent, cash provided by
operations.

We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, primarily due to the
impact of weather conditions on the electric infrastructure and the corresponding spending by our
customers on electric service and repairs. We may experience seasonal working capital needs from
approximately August through February in connection with our storm restoration services. The
increased service activity causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections, leading
to increased accounts receivable during those periods. However, our ability to satisfy our obligations or to
fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance, which to a certain extent
is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors
beyond our control.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased 29.5 million to 37.3 million for
the six months ended December 31, 2006 from 7.8 million for the six months ended December 31,
2005. The increase in cash from operating activities was primarily due to the increase in cash
flows from working capital that was caused by the relatively low levels of storm restoration work
in the six months ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year.
Significant levels of storm restoration work, such as that experienced in the prior year, can
temporarily cause a substantial increase in working capital and a subsequent decrease in cash flows
from working capital. The increase in cash flows from working capital was partially offset by the
decrease in net income.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased 1.4 million to 22.0 million for the six
months ended December 31, 2006 from 23.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2005.
Capital expenditures for both periods consisted primarily of purchases of vehicles and equipment
used to service our customers. As of December 31, 2006, we have approximately
 31.5 million in surety bonds outstanding. In addition, we have provided collateral in the form of
a letter of credit to sureties in the amount of 4.0 million, which is included in the total
letters of credit outstanding above.

annual storm restoration revenues have ranged from a low of 7.0 million to a high of 185.3
million during the seven fiscal years ended June 30, 2006. Due to the unpredictable nature of
storms, the level of our storm restoration revenues fluctuates from period to period.

Inflation 

Due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the first six months of fiscal
2006 and 2005, inflation did not have a significant effect on our results.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2007 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2006 

Revenues. Revenues decreased 1.9 , or 2.9 million, to 154.3 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2007 from 157.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006. The decrease
was due to a 13.2 million decrease in powerline revenues partially offset by a 10.3 million
increase in storm restoration revenues compared to the prior fiscal year. Total billable hours
decreased by 8.9 during the three months ended March 31, 2007 compared to the same period in the
prior year. Powerline billable man-hours
decreased 13.2 and revenue per man-hour increased 4.8 . Powerline revenues consist primarily of
continued maintenance projects with existing customers.

Our storm restoration revenues increased 115.7 to 19.2 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2007 from 8.9 million for the same period in the prior year. This increase was
primarily related to damages caused by winter storms in the three months ended March 31, 2007. Our
storm restoration revenues are highly volatile and unpredictable.

Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 59.1 , or 10.2 million, to 27.5 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2007 from 17.3 million for the same period in the prior year. Gross profit
as a percentage of revenues increased to 17.8 for the three months ended March 31, 2007 from 11.0 
the three months ended March 31, 2006, primarily due to the increase in higher margin storm
restoration revenues, an increase in billable rates from recent contract negotiations, and exiting
certain lower margin accounts and services.

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 2.6
million to 12.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007 from 9.8 million for the three
months ended March 31,
2006. Revenues decreased 20.8 , or 118.9 million, to 452.5 million for the nine months
ended March 31, 2007 from 571.4 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was
due to a 129.4 million decrease in storm revenues partially offset by a 10.5 million increase in
powerline revenues. We generated substantial revenues from storm restoration services in the nine
months ended March 31, 2006 related to major storms impacting the Gulf Coast and Florida. Total
billable hours decreased 19.1 during the nine months ended March 31, 2007 compared to the same
period in the prior fiscal year. Our crews worked significant amounts of overtime during storm
restoration projects during the nine months ended March 31, 2006. In addition, our average
revenue-producing headcount decreased 7.0 during the nine months ending March 31, 2007 from the
same period in the prior year.

Our powerline service revenues increased 2.7 to 406.9 million for the nine months ended
March 31, 2007 from 396.4 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2006. Powerline billable
man-hours were virtually unchanged and revenue per man-hour increased 2.4 . The growth in
powerline revenues is primarily a result of continued maintenance projects with existing customers.

Our storm restoration revenues decreased 74.0 to 45.6 million for the nine months ended
March 31, 2007 from 175.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2006. We generated
unusually significant revenues from storm restoration services during the first nine months of the
prior year due primarily to Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma that impacted the Gulf
Coast and Florida.

Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased 33.6 million to 71.8 million for the nine months ended
March 31, 2007 from 105.4 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2006. Gross profit as a
percentage of revenues decreased to 15.9 from 18.4 during the nine months ended March 31, 2006
primarily due to the significant decrease in higher margin storm restoration revenues and losses in
our Florida operation in early fiscal 2007.

General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 2.7
million to 34.7 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2007 from 32.0 million for the nine
months ended March 31, 2006. Our primary source of cash for the nine months ended March 31, 2007
was cash provided by operations. Our primary sources of cash for the nine months ended March 31,
2006 were cash provided by the issuance of stock in our initial public offering and, to a lesser
extent, cash provided by operations.

We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, primarily due to the
impact of weather conditions on the electric infrastructure and the corresponding spending by our
customers on electric service and repairs. We may experience working capital needs in connection
with our storm restoration services. The increased service activity causes an excess of customer
billings over customer collections, leading to increased accounts receivable during those periods.
In the past, we have utilized borrowings under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility
to satisfy normal operating costs during these periods.

As of March 31, 2007, our cash totaled 0.6 million and we had 66.4 million available under
the 90.0 million revolving portion of our senior credit facility (after giving effect to
outstanding standby letters of credit of approximately 23.6 million).

We believe that our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, and
borrowings available under our senior credit facility will be adequate to meet our ordinary course
liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, our ability to satisfy our obligations or to
fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance, which to a certain extent
is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors
beyond our control.

nine months ended March 31, 2007 from 59.4 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2006. The
decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to the decrease in storm
activity and was partially offset by favorable receivable collection trends.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased 9.7 million to 23.1 million for the nine
months ended March 31, 2007 from 32.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2006. Capital
expenditures for both periods consisted primarily of purchases of vehicles and equipment used to
service our customers.

months ended March 31, 2007 from 26.7 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2006. As of March 31, 2007, we have approximately
 35.2 million in surety bonds outstanding. In addition, we have provided collateral in the form of
a letter of credit to sureties in the amount of 4.0 million, which is included in the total
letters of credit outstanding above.

Seasonality; Fluctuations of Results 

Our services are performed outdoors, causing our results of operations to be subject to
seasonal variations due to weather conditions. These seasonal variations affect both our powerline
and storm restoration services. Extended periods of rain affect the deployment of our powerline
crews, particularly with respect to underground work. During the winter months, demand for
powerline work is generally lower due to inclement weather. In addition, demand for powerline work
generally increases during the spring months due to improved weather conditions and is typically
the highest during the summer due to better weather conditions. Demand for electrical repairs may
be impacted during the fall months due to damage caused by weather conditions, such as hurricanes.
In addition, our results of operations are subject to significant variations related to storm
restoration services. As an illustration of the volatility of our storm restoration services, our
annual storm restoration revenues have ranged from a low of 7.0 million to a high of 185.3
million during the seven fiscal years ended June 30, 2006. Due to the unpredictable nature of
storms, the level of our storm restoration revenues fluctuates from period to period.

Inflation 

Due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the first nine months of fiscal
2007 and 2006, inflation did not have a significant effect on our results.
